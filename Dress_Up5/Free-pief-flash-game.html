<h4>Game Description:</h4> Get dressed in the correct order to experience this love story and its ending.

Creator's Statement : 

A dress up game, whereby when an item is chosen, a small poetry window is displayed evoking memories associated with that piece of clothing.

After dressing, you will be scored 0-100%, depending on the order of clothing clicked ; 100% is given for the correct order of the "story".

The story is about time travel (symbolised by the Travis, the Moonstar), longing and missed opportunities.

"If only I wore brown that day maybe he would have noticed me."

It is also, of course, a gay love story.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
I remember
my first pearl necklace.

You made it for me.

It was such a surprise.


I'm just another notch
on the belt to you.

You have so many
but I only have

you.


These angel wings
were half price at Walmart.

You picked them up from
the shelves and smiled.

You said, "Baby ,
take a walk on the wild side."


I used to wear such common
jeans.
black denim; tight.
You turn to me one night,
straight, no chaser.
Keep it simple,
keep yourself open.
So I did.


The soft fabric brushes
my nipples like your
sweet carress.
I couldn't care less.

What they all think of me.
When I put this on.


This hasn't worked
since the time you
stole it from me.

I want those memories
back.
I want you
back.


These sandals are worn,
like my heart.
trampled underfoot,
whence i saw you
with that tart.


If you want to
destroy my sweater.
Watch it unravel
as I walk away.
Pretty soon, I'll be naked.

Lying on the floor, I'll come
undone.


These aren't mine.
These are yours.

Did you know I took them?
Do you even miss them?

I wear them always.


You never told me
what you really liked.

I'll even go yiffy
for you.

Purr?
