Hi everyone!! this is my first submission! I have a lot of open projects so this is the first actual game that Ive managed to finish.
Its a dress up game but I think its pretty good for first submission, it has a lot of parts and you can also rotate and copy the parts!
thanks alot to NG forums and tutorials for helping me with the code.
The song: "Take Five" by Dave Brubeck.
