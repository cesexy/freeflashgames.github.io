 <p>Poker Texa...</p><div id="d">1.	Depending on the limit and betting structure, players will place out blinds and antes so there is an initial amount to get things started. This is called posting. 

2.	The dealer shuffles up a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
 
3.	Each player is dealt two private cards face down. These are called your hole cards or pocket cards. 

4.	Then there is a round of betting starting with the player to the left of the blinds. This is the preflop betting round. Like most games of poker, players can call, raise, or fold. 

5.	After the betting round ends, the dealer discards the top card of the deck. This is called a burn card. This is done to prevent cheating. 

6.	The dealer then flips the next three cards face up on the table. This is called the flop. These are communal cards that anyone can use in combination with their two pocket cards to form a poker hand. 

7.	The player to the left of the dealer starts another betting round. 

8.	After the betting concludes, the dealer burns again then flips another communal card onto the table. This is called the turn. 

9.	The player to the left of the dealer begins another round of betting. In many types of games, this is where the bet size doubles. 

10.	Again, the dealer burns a card and places a final card face up on the table. This is called the river. Players can now use any of the five cards on the table or the two cards in their pocket to form a five card poker hand. 

11.	There is one final round of betting starting with the player to the left of the dealer. 

12.	After that, we have the showdown. Players who have not folded reveal their hands, beginning with the player to the left of the last player to call. Players use a combination of their pocket cards and the community cards to form a five card poker hand. 

13.	The player who shows the best hand wins! Although sometimes players with the same hand split the pot.</div>

 <p>Penguin So...</p><div id="d">The Penguin Solitaire is created by British game scholar David Parlett, and it requires careful planning more than just luck. Your goal is to move all cards to the 4 foundations, building up by suit and starting with the cards of the same rank as the first card dealt to the leftmost tableau pile (the "beak"). When the game starts, each of the 7 tableau piles at the top of the screen will be dealt 7 face-up cards. The first card dealt to the leftmost tableau pile will become the beak, and the other three cards of the same rank will be dealt to the vertically arranged foundations at the right, leaving one foundation empty. For example, if the beak is a 6 of spades, all other 6s will be dealt to the foundations. For the empty foundation, you will need to move the beak to it. 7 empty reserve cells are located at the bottom of the screen. The foundations are to be built up by suit starting with the beak, and wrapping from K to A if necessary. Cards in the tableau piles are to be built down by suit, wrapping from A to K if necessary. Each time you can move a card or a group of cards built down by suit to another tableau pile. Each empty reserve cell can hold 1 card, and cards in the reserve cells can be moved to a tableau pile or a foundation. When a tableau pile becomes empty, only a card of the rank immediately below the beak or a group of cards starting with that rank can moved to the empty tableau pile, for example, if the beak is a 6, only a 5 or a group start with a 5 can be moved the empty tableau pile. Try to free the beak as soon as possible and make good use of the reserve cells to have your name shine on the leaderboard!</div>

 <p>Prehistori...</p><div id="d">Many years ago the Earth was settled by ancient creatures, some of them spoiled people's lives greatly. It was a horrifying night. Terrifying dinosaurs attacked the village of one boy's prehistoric tribe: they trampled the fire and killed the whole tribe. The only saved man turned out to be the boy, who had gone hunting that night. When he returned home, his grief was endless. He lost everything and most importantly the fire! He spent many days sitting near the extinct fire and mourning his relatives.

But his stomach couldn't stand the starvation and the boy felt hungry. So he went hunting in the forest. He found there a cave. It took several days for him to feel at home and to try to kindle the fire. The unhappy boy gave up all hope of eating some roasted meat and to warm near the fire. But the gods of fortune felt sorry for the boy. A tornado passed near the forest accompanied by lighting. The lightning set fire to the tree. This fact astonished the kid greatly. He took the stick and ran towards the tree. So the fire was started in the cave.</div>
