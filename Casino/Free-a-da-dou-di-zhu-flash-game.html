 <p>Penguin So...</p><div id="d">The Penguin Solitaire is created by British game scholar David Parlett, and it requires careful planning more than just luck. Your goal is to move all cards to the 4 foundations, building up by suit and starting with the cards of the same rank as the first card dealt to the leftmost tableau pile (the "beak"). When the game starts, each of the 7 tableau piles at the top of the screen will be dealt 7 face-up cards. The first card dealt to the leftmost tableau pile will become the beak, and the other three cards of the same rank will be dealt to the vertically arranged foundations at the right, leaving one foundation empty. For example, if the beak is a 6 of spades, all other 6s will be dealt to the foundations. For the empty foundation, you will need to move the beak to it. 7 empty reserve cells are located at the bottom of the screen. The foundations are to be built up by suit starting with the beak, and wrapping from K to A if necessary. Cards in the tableau piles are to be built down by suit, wrapping from A to K if necessary. Each time you can move a card or a group of cards built down by suit to another tableau pile. Each empty reserve cell can hold 1 card, and cards in the reserve cells can be moved to a tableau pile or a foundation. When a tableau pile becomes empty, only a card of the rank immediately below the beak or a group of cards starting with that rank can moved to the empty tableau pile, for example, if the beak is a 6, only a 5 or a group start with a 5 can be moved the empty tableau pile. Try to free the beak as soon as possible and make good use of the reserve cells to have your name shine on the leaderboard!</div>

 <p>Blackjack...</p><div id="d">To beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a count of 21 in order to win as much money from the dealer (the casino) as you can.

The total of the cards in your hand are displayed beside the hand. This is appropriate since in a real casino the dealer will usually call out the total of the players hand. This is the important part of the hand. Remember that the object of the game is to "beat the dealer" even it means letting the dealer bust. A bust occurs when the value of cards in your hand exceeds 21. The dealer must play by specific rules, primarily the dealer must stand on a value of 17 or greater. That is, if the dealer has less than 17 he must take another card. The most common card in the deck is a 10 (Ten, Jack, Queen or King) therefore by looking at the dealer's up card you can make a good guess about the value of their hand. If the up card is a 7 then you can safely assume that the down card is a ten so the value of their hand has a good probability of being 17.</div>
