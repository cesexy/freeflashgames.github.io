<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Welcome to Good Ol' Poker, the classic game of 5 card stud, but with some twists.

To start things off, pick a character that will represent you in the game. Each character has unique attributes (like aggressiveness of play style or cheat ability)  and special ability (like the ability to peek into opponents cards).

The purpose of the game is to get the best score (amount of money) in a poker round. A round consists of 15 hands. The hand is a classic set of dealing, betting and drawing.

You can use your character's special ability to cheat in the game, but only when the Confidence bar is loaded to maximum.
The bar loads 10% each hand and 35% when you win a hand. Use your ability very carefully, as sometimes the opponents will notice that something is wrong! Good luck!

 <p>Alternatio...</p><div id="d">Join the league of solitaire elites and see if you can conquer the difficult Alternation Solitaire! Using 2 decks of standard playing cards, your goal in this game is to move all cards by suit from A to K to the foundations. When the game starts, 8 empty foundations will be located at the top of the screen. Each of the 7 tableau piles below the foundations will be dealt 7 cards alternating between face-up and face-down, i.e. the first card on a tableau pile is face-up, the second card is face-down, the third card is face-up, and so on. The remaining cards will be placed face-down to the stock pile on the left of the tableau piles, and 1 face-up card will be dealt to the discard pile below the stock pile. The tableau piles are to be built down by alternating colors, and each time you can move a card or a group of cards to another tableau pile according to this rule. The face-down cards on the tableau piles will be turned face-up when the cards on top of them are removed. If a tableau pile becomes empty, you can move a K or a group starts with a K to it. The top card on the discard pile can be moved to a tableau pile or a foundation. If you have run out of moves, you can click the stock pile to deal a new card to the discard pile. But if the stock pile becomes empty and you cannot make any more moves, you lose. Make wise moves to solve the peculiar puzzle!</div>
