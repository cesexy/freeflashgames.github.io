 <p>Japanese S...</p><div id="d">The man, who stands in the foreground of the picture you see, is the strongest and the most dexterous in emperor's regular army. This evening he is on sentry duty, because of the following occurrence.

A month ago Japanese emperor had built a new palace and a park to everyone's entertainment. Men, women, boys, girls and people in years loved it very much. There were many calm places for old people, several secluded nooks for loving couples, an amusement park, a field for childish sports and one special area with playing machines. That area was the centre of everyone's attention and that kind of amusement used to be people's big draw. For an obvious reason the park was simultaneously the object of admiration and the object of envy for other rulers. Everything took its normal course when one night several thieves made his appearance in the park. That people were sent by a Chinese emperor. He did it not to be bursting with envy. First of all thieves ought to pilfer game machines, but they couldn't as they were mounted an honest effort. That fact made them malicious and they began smashing up the park. After their dirty deal they disappeared.</div>

 <p>Cruel Soli...</p><div id="d">Solitaire veterans, time to prove your possession of talent and fortune in Cruel Solitaire! Your goal in this game is to move all cards by suit from A to K to the foundations. When the game starts, all 4 Aces will be moved to the 4 vertically arranged foundations on the right of the screen. Then each of the 12 tableau piles in the middle will be dealt 4 face-up cards. An empty stock pile is located on the bottom left. The tableau piles are to be built down by suit, and each time only the top card on a tableau pile can be moved. If a tableau pile becomes empty, you cannot place any card on it. If you want to redeal the cards or if you have run out of moves, click the empty stock pile. Then all cards on the tableau piles will be collected starting with the last pile on the lower right to the first pile on the top left. The cards collected will then be dealt to the tableau piles again without shuffle, starting with the first pile on the top left, with each pile being dealt 4 face-up cards until all cards are dealt. The number of redeals is unlimited, but if you cannot make at least one move after a redeal, you lose. Will you be able to solve the advanced riddle successfully?</div>
