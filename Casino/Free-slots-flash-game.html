 <p>Lucky Card...</p><div id="d">Are you an apprentice in divination or a powerful fortune teller? Claim yourself the professional title in Lucky Card, in which you will guess whether the rank of the next card is greater than or smaller than the previous one. When the game starts, 24 upturned cards will be dealt and divided into 3 rows, and you will have 10 seconds to observe them. After that, the cards will be collected and shuffled, then downturned and dealt to the rows. A card from the stock pile at the top left corner will be revealed, and you need to guess whether the rank of the first card on the top row is greater than or smaller than that of the revealed card. The ranks of the cards from high to low are as follows: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. Make your guess by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen, and the result will be shown immediately. You can receive bonuses if correct guesses are made consecutively, but if you have accumulated 3 wrong answers, the game ends. May the luck be with you!</div>
