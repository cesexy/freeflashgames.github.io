<h4>Game Description:</h4> Popular card game against the computer.

</div>
						

<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
On the first screen click the Play button to start. There are a few ways to play the card game often called Go Fish. In my Fish game I have used one of the more common ways of playing. The idea of the game is to collect sets or books of 4 cards of the same value and the winner is the player with the most sets at the end of the game. The game is over when all the cards have been dealt from the pack or one player runs out of cards. The game is played against the computer.

On the main screen you will see the pack of 52 playing cards in the middle of the screen and a Start button just below. Click the Start button and you and the computer player are automatically dealt 7 cards each, which are sorted into order for you. A row of buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen just below a black box which has instructions on how to play throughout the game. Each of the buttons relates to each of the suits of cards in the pack i.e. Ace's, 2's, 3's etc. You will notice that the only ones highlighted and available to click on are those cards that are in your hand. In other words you cannot ask for a card from your opponent that you don't have one of yourself.

The idea is to ask your opponent, the computer, if it has any cards that you need to make up a set of four of that number. Click one of the buttons to ask the computer. If it has one or more of your cards then they will fall from his hand to the bottom of the screen and be automatically sorted and placed into your hand of cards. You then have another go and keep having goes until the computer calls FISH. If it gives you enough of a number to make a set of four, then the set will be placed in the left hand box in the middle of the screen and 1 will be added to your Sets total. Remember the one with the most sets at the end of the game wins.

If the computer does not have any of the cards you have asked for it will call FISH, telling you to pick up an extra card from the pack. You do this by a single left click of the mouse on the pack in the middle. One card will then be added to your hand. If that card is one you asked for, it will be shown and you will find you have another go. If not it is then the computer's turn. It will ask you if you have a card by a message in the black instruction box. You will have two buttons highlighted, one saying Yes and the other Fish. Click Yes if you have one or more of the cards asked for and those cards will move to the top of the playing area into the computer's hand of cards. If you don't have any of the cards asked for, click Fish. If you make a mistake, the computer will check and ask you to try again. The computer will then pick up a card from the pack. Again if it picks up a card that it asked for, it will be shown and the computer has another go. Play continues making sets of four until the pack in the middle runs out or one of the players has no cards left. The winner is then the one with the most sets and 1 will be added to their total next to Games in the appropriate box in the middle of the screen. If both players have the same number of Sets then it is a draw and neither player has anything added to their Games total. When the game is over a Next Game button will then appear. Click this button if you want another game.

 <p>Top Cards...</p><div id="d">Top cards is about accumulating points for your hand, similar to Black Jack or Pontoon. Each player receives exactly the same cards. You can request as many cards as you like. 2s to 10s count according to their face value, while the picture cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as 10 points and an Ace may count as either 1 point or 11 points. The closer you get to 21, the more points you are awarded. 
If you get 21 exactly you get maximum points, but a word of caution: If you go over 21 you lose points! So be careful...should you look for another card on 16 points or not?</div>
