<h4>Game Description:</h4> 52 Weeks of Game Development: Week 1. The "52 Weeks of Game Development" project is a 2012 New Year's resolution I made to create a new game every week.

This game is based on the dice game known as "Evens and Odds". You throw five dice and subtract the odds from the evens. In this new version, you are allowed to hold dice to be used in the next round, but doing so uses up one of your remaining dice rolls. 

A game of chance with a bit of strategy.
