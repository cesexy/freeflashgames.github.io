<h4>Game Description:</h4> A tongue-in-cheek gambling game combining elements from Texas Hold'Em poker and Yahtzee. The computer generated opponents are blind to all non communal dice and perform background simulations and basic risk analysis to determine their decisions.

 <p>Japanese P...</p><div id="d">Are you looking for a game that rouses your feelings and strikes your mind? Japanese Pai Gow Poker is what you really need! Just look at the settings: a fool moon, as you know, promises extraordinary events.

Those events started a few days before when a vessel sailed to the open sea. There were ten seamen and a captain on the board. They transferred cargo of scientific books and manuscripts. Nothing boded ill: the sea was calm and the wind had the right direction. But a sudden storm broke out. That storm was the heaviest people ever saw. Sailors clew down and tied the cargo and themselves with ropes to the ship. As there were no more ropes to bind food and a splendid rigging of the vessel, those things were washed overbroad, but people didn't lose hope. The storm had been raging for three days and at the end of the third day seamen saw a boat and a man in it. With the shout ''a man overbroad!'' they saved him. He appeared to be Japanese and his island located alongside. The seamen conveyed him home. When the storm quieted down the Japanese invited the crew to his house, as he wanted to show his gratitude to them. At home the man fed them, placed comfortable and showed the game Japanese Pai Gow Poker. All men liked the game because it gave food for thought and tickled their nerves.

Play this game and you will find it hazardous and fascinating!</div>
