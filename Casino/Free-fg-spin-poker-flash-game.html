She spent her childhood in a far away country having no chance to exploit her potentialities. Once, her elder brother taught her to play cards. It was the simplest game, but it made an impression on the girl. Since that day the girl became crazy about gambling games: she collected any sort of information about cards, developed sleight of hand and learned tricks. Pungent sensations, risk and hazard drew her with insurmountable power.</div>

 <p>Demons and...</p><div id="d">A fantastic crossover of the famous Demon Solitaire and Forty Thieves Solitaire, Demons and Thieves will test your organization ability amidst different arrangements. Your goal in this game is to move all cards to the 8 foundations at the top of the screen, building up by suit and starting with the cards of the same rank as the card dealt to the leftmost foundation, wrapping from K to A if necessary. When the game starts, 1 face-up card will be dealt to the leftmost foundation serving as the starting rank. Under the foundations are 9 tableau piles. Each of the 4 tableau piles on the left side will be dealt 1 face-up card, while each of the 5 tableau piles on the right side will be dealt 8 face-up cards. 13 face-up cards will be dealt to the reserve pile on the left of the tableau piles. The remaining cards will be placed face-down to the stock pile at the top left corner of the screen, and 1 face-up card will be dealt to the discard pile on the right of the stock pile. The 4 tableau piles on the left side are to be built down by alternating colors, while the 5 tableau piles on the right side are to be built down by suit. In both cases, cards should be wrapped from A to K if necessary. You can move a group of cards to another tableau pile if it forms a legal descending sequence in its current tableau pile, for example, a 7 of spades and a 6 of hearts on a tableau pile on the left side can be moved as a group to a tableau pile on the right side, since they form a legal sequence on the left side. This kind of card movements is called "shift". The top cards on the reserve pile and the discard pile can be moved to a tableau pile or a foundation. If you have run out of moves, you can click the stock pile to deal a new card to the discard pile. The stock pile allows 2 redeals. Challenge your skills now and make as many strategic shifts among the tableau piles as possible!</div>
