<h4>Game Description:</h4> As you know the object of Craps is to predict the outcome of a roll of the dice. It is as difficult as to predict somebody's fate.

That samurai couldn't predict his fate too he didn't know that he would wander about different countries with the purpose to find something unusual for his emperor. That march was the most tiresome and perilous in his life. He saw many interesting things, which were created by clever and ingenious people, but there was no thing to strike emperor's imagination. After ten years of the searching the emaciated man decided to go home. On his way back he stopped in one house to spend the night. The masters were hospitable and the food was excellent and what attracted the man's attention greatly was the game people played after dinner. That game was absorbing and samurai bought its rules and equipment. After that excellent acquisition, the man was going home in elevated mood when he was tightened in the ring of highway robbers. They took up the swards and the battle began. Our hero left much blood on the earth but all his enemies were beaten! Samurai returned to the emperor's palace as a winner and introduced the game. It made a great impression on the imperator and he was promoted to the rank of commander-in-chief in his army.

 <p>Osmosis So...</p><div id="d">Osmosis, also known as Treasure Trove, is an interesting solitaire game played with a deck of 52 standard playing cards. Your goal in this game is to move all cards by suit regardless of ranks to the foundations. When the game starts, you will be given 4 vertically arranged reserve piles on the left of the screen. Each of these reserve piles has 3 face-down cards plus 1 face-up card on the top. In the middle of the screen are 4 vertically arranged foundations. 1 face-up card will be dealt to the top foundation as the starting rank, while the other foundations are empty. The remaining cards are placed face-down to the stock pile at the top right, and then 1 face-up card will be dealt to the discard pile underneath. The foundations are to be built by suit regardless of ranks. Note that the three empty foundations must begin with cards of the same rank as the first card of the top foundation, for example, if the first card of the top foundation is an 8 of hearts, the other foundations must also start with an 8. Cards in the foundations are fanned from left to right. After a card of the starting rank has been placed to an empty foundation, you can move a card to this foundation if a card of the same rank has already been placed in the foundation above it. For example, an 8 of spades has been moved to the second foundation, and in the top foundation are 8, 3 and J of hearts. In this case, you can move 3 and J of spades to the second foundation. Each time you can click and drag the top card from a reserve pile or the discard pile to the foundations. If you have run out of moves, you can click the stock pile to deal a new card to the discard pile. When the stock pile has run out of cards, you can click the empty stock pile to redeal. Play now and see how quickly you can collect all cards!</div>
