<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Klondike Solitaire uses one 52 card deck. Cards are dealt from the deck into the 7 tableau piles with the number of cards per pile increasing from one to seven from left to right. The top card is face up, the rest face down. The remaining cards in the deck become the stock.

The object of the game is to move the four aces to the foundations as they become available and to build each foundation up in suit from Ace to King.

Cards can be drawn from the stock and flipped onto the waste pile in groups of three with the top exposed card available for play onto appropriate tableau piles or foundations. 

Tableau piles can be built down by alternating color of descending value beginning with the King down through the 2. Stacks of exposed cards can be moved from one tableau pile to another as long as the proper sequence is maintained. the top hidden card on a tableau pile may be flipped over when all exposed cards are moved from the stack. Stacks of cards beginning with a King may be moved to open tableau piles.

Your goal in the game is to move all cards by suit from A to K to the foundations. When the game starts, 4 empty foundations will appear on the right of the screen. 13 tableau piles are located on the left of the foundations, with 7 piles at the top and 6 piles at the bottom. Then each of the tableau piles will be dealt 4 face-up cards. The 4 Kings will be placed to the bottom of the tableau piles. Cards on the tableau piles are to be built down regardless of suits. Note that only 1 card can be moved each time, and if a tableau pile becomes empty, it cannot be filled. Complete the task as quickly as you can to receive great rewards!</div>
