<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
The object of the game is to get to 21. Click on the "Hit Me" buttons to add the current card to its corresponding column. Like the classic game "Blackjack," face cards are worth 10, aces are worth 1 or 11 and all other cards are worth their face value. You will get more time when you get make 21.  If you go over 21 you bust and lose points. You can get rid of a card by hitting the button labelled "Click Here To Discard" but you will lose time if you discard. 

Every time you score 21 you will get 10 point times the 1x, 2x, 3x, or 4x indicator. For example, if you get 21 when the 3x indicator is lit up, you will receive 10 x 3 points or 30 points. 
If you get 21 when a column is lit up (light blue) you will go
the bonus pinball level to earn bonus points. You will also get bonus points when you make it through a full deck of cards. 
You will lose points if you bust (go over 21).

 <p>Penguin So...</p><div id="d">The Penguin Solitaire is created by British game scholar David Parlett, and it requires careful planning more than just luck. Your goal is to move all cards to the 4 foundations, building up by suit and starting with the cards of the same rank as the first card dealt to the leftmost tableau pile (the "beak"). When the game starts, each of the 7 tableau piles at the top of the screen will be dealt 7 face-up cards. The first card dealt to the leftmost tableau pile will become the beak, and the other three cards of the same rank will be dealt to the vertically arranged foundations at the right, leaving one foundation empty. For example, if the beak is a 6 of spades, all other 6s will be dealt to the foundations. For the empty foundation, you will need to move the beak to it. 7 empty reserve cells are located at the bottom of the screen. The foundations are to be built up by suit starting with the beak, and wrapping from K to A if necessary. Cards in the tableau piles are to be built down by suit, wrapping from A to K if necessary. Each time you can move a card or a group of cards built down by suit to another tableau pile. Each empty reserve cell can hold 1 card, and cards in the reserve cells can be moved to a tableau pile or a foundation. When a tableau pile becomes empty, only a card of the rank immediately below the beak or a group of cards starting with that rank can moved to the empty tableau pile, for example, if the beak is a 6, only a 5 or a group start with a 5 can be moved the empty tableau pile. Try to free the beak as soon as possible and make good use of the reserve cells to have your name shine on the leaderboard!</div>
