Throughout this simulation game, you will assume the role of a father, and you will need to make different decisions based on the given scenarios, for example in the first scenario, the baby will fall when he is trying to walk. You need to decide whether to help or encourage him by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom right corner of the screen. Your child will grow based on your decisions in the game, and you can click the magnifying glass at the top right corner to view the current growth of your child, in terms of creativity, family, justice, independence and rebelliousness. Eventually the child will grow up to become someone special - will he turn to be a malicious bully or a rightful hero? The decision is yours!</div>

This happens to be my first game ever, which I made for an intro programming type class. My goal was to make a simple game as complete and polished as possible, as opposed to a large game I would never get back to. I am very interested in hearing what you think, good and/or bad, so please let me know!</div>
