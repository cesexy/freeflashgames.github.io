 <p>Math Lines...</p><div id="d">Add up to 10 then destroy the balls, and the golden trophy shall be yours! In the game of Math Lines, your target is to remove the marbles by forming pairs that sum up to 10 so as to clear the line. When the game starts, a line of marbles marked with numbers 1 to 9 will be rolling on the path of a maze and moving towards the hole at the end of the path. Between the lines of the maze you will be given a launcher, in which a marble will be placed inside and ready to be shot, while the next piece will also be displayed. You may move your mouse to change the shooting direction of the launcher, or press Spacebar on your keyboard to switch the pieces, then click to release the marble. When the released ball forms a sum of 10 with an adjacent ball, those balls will be destroyed. Note that you can remove all adjacent balls of the same number with one shot, for example, when you shoot a ball of 7 and it forms a pair with a ball of 3, all of the adjacent pieces marked with 3 will also be removed. Continue the process until the whole line of balls are cleared, then you can proceed to the next level. Occasionally a coin will appear at the corner of the screen, and you may shoot the coin so that the balls can be sorted according to their colors for a while. If the balls reach the hole at the end of the path, you lose the game. Ease into the arithmetic mazes and experience the excitement of non-stop calculations and actions!</div>
