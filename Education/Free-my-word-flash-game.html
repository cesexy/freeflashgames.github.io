<h4>Game Description:</h4> My Word! is a word game seemingly in the traditional mold, but several features set it apart from other games in the genre. The unique 3D board allows the player to lookahead for the next incoming letters, and if they are to keep formulating words, they must manage the grid carefully! With a dictionary of over 150,000 words and a chilled-out style, My Word! is a charming and relaxed addition to the genre.

today's story:

THE BELL

People said "The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting." For a strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town. It was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a moment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude made too great a noise.

Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see the evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much more distinctly.
