<h4>Game Description:</h4> Can you discover the treasuries of words among the golden letter blocks? In this game, your task is to use the given tiles to form words with 3 to 8 letters. You will be given a grid which contains numerous letter blocks, and you can form words by clicking the blocks. A selected tile will be marked in red, while its adjacent pieces will also be highlighted. When you are forming a word, the next coming letter must be adjacent to the previous letter. You may click the first letter again if you would like to cancel your selections. After you have finished spelling a word, click the final letter again to submit. A score will be given based on the length of the word. The number of words need to be formed will be shown on the left of the screen, and you need to fulfill the requirement in order to proceed. If you would like to get a new letter block, you can click an empty space in the play area, but note that blocks will also be automatically added to the grid from time to time. When the letter blocks pile up and all columns reach the top of the playing area, the game ends. Compete with friends and family and see who is the ultimate word master!

 <p>Tri Peaks ...</p><div id="d">Will you rise above the top of the peaks or be defeated by the mountains? In Tri Peaks Solitaire, your goal is to move all cards from the three peaks to the discard pile. When the game opens, 18 downturned cards will be dealt to form three connected peaks, while 10 upturned cards will be placed under the peaks. 1 upturned card will be dealt to the discard pile at the bottom of the screen, and the remaining cards will be downturned and placed to the stock pile on the left of the discard pile. You can click to move an upturned card on the peak which is of an immediately adjacent ranking with the card on the discard pile regardless of their suits, for example, when the Ace of clubs is on the discard pile, any K or any 2 from the peaks can be moved to the discard pile. The downturned cards on the peaks will reveal when they are no longer blocked by other cards. You may click the stock pile to deal a new card whenever necessary. The game ends when the stock pile is used up but no more cards can be removed from the peaks. Try to connect as many moves as you can to win the golden crown!</div>
