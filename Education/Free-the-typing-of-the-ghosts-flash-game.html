<h4>Game Description:</h4> For many years, the evil spirits have been haunting the deserted mansion. Being the apprentice to an exorcist, you are asked to destroy the ghosts by typing the words and numbers shown on them. Simply use your keyboard and type as quickly as possible to cast away the ghosts, or they will approach and claw you. If you have typed a wrong word, you may press the Backspace key to cancel it. You will start with 5 lives as shown at the top left corner, but when you are caught by a ghost, one life will be deducted. The game ends if all 5 lives are gone. When you advance in the game, the ghosts will move at a faster pace and you need to speed up in order to survive. Exterminate all of the demons and purify the ancient castle!

today's story:

THE FIR TREE

Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.

He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, "Oh, how pretty he is! What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear....</div>
