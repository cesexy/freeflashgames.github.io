 <p>Creature C...</p><div id="d">Creature Capture is a fun and colorful fraction-based card game where the goal of the game is to own more of the board than your opponent! Players engage in both solo and multiplayer gameplay as they collect cards and build strategies. Opponents take turns playing their creature-themed cards to a central board, causing battles between opposing cards along the way. The victor of each battle is determined by one of three battle rules: largest number wins, smallest number wins, and closest number to 1/2 wins. Players can use power cards to augment any creature, allowing them to perform complex fraction-based arithmetic to win battles. Additionally, players build decks from the cards they have collected and challenge their friends to a Creature Capture duel! These duels can be played online or offline. Creature Capture currently features over 20 levels, with new levels and features on the way. Pick Creature Capture today as a fun and engaging part of your collection!</div>
