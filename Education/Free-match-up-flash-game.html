<h4>Game Description:</h4> Match Up game to help with learning English. Includes synonyms, antonyms and homophones games and a facility to create your own game lists.

<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Match up words or phrases by clicking the grey button next to the correct answer. Instructions are included on each screen. On the first screen you need to click one of the Play buttons to start. The main Match Up game screen has a drop down list of 9 synonyms games, 10 antonyms games and 9 homophones games plus two examples of the type of game you can create yourself in My Match Up. To play My Match Up you need to create your own game list by clicking the create/edit games button. This will take you to the screen explained below.

Match Up Screens
On this screen you will see two columns, A and B. Each column has 10 rows. At the top of the screen is a drop down box containing a list of the games available to be played in the program. Click on this box and choose a file from the list. There are 180 synonyms (different words with the same meaning) in 9 synonym games, 200 antonyms (words that have opposite meanings) in 10 antonym games and 180 homophones (words that sound the same but with a different meaning) in 9 homophone games.

Once chosen, the file will be loaded and all the rows in both columns will be filled with the words or phrases from the file. To match a pair up, you will be shown a random word or phrase as a question. Study column A to see which word or phrase matches your question and click the empty grey bar next to it. If it matches, a green tick will appear and you will be awarded points. If it doesn't match, you will receive a red cross and have points deducted. Match all 10 rows up to complete the game. When you complete a game a Certificate scroll will appear on the right of the screen. Clicking it will take you to the Certificate screen. The My Match Up screen is played in exactly the same way except that your own lists, once created, will appear in the drop down list.

Create/Edit My Match Up Games Screen
This can be selected from the main menu and is a facility to make up and edit your own word/phrases files. Follow the instructions on the screen to create or edit your own files.
