<h4>Game Description:</h4> An online maths game with an almost infinite supply of math subtraction problems to solve.

</div>
						

<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
On the opening screen you will find that your mouse pointer turns into a hand over the three types of problems you can choose. Choose a type of subtraction sum that you would like to try ranging from single to three figure problems.

The Questions 
Once you have clicked on your choice, a random question will appear which you have to solve by clicking on the numbers in green in the white boxes at the bottom of the blackboard. Sums in the second and third level have a green box around the column of numbers that you should solve first. They also have a Borrow One button below the sum's bottom line, which is explained below. You will be told visually and audibly whether you have got the answer correct or not. When you are able to try the next sum, the Next Sum button will become active at the bottom of the board. At anytime you can try a new level by clicking on the New Level button at the bottom. 

Borrow One button 
If the number at the top of a column is smaller than the one at the bottom, then it is not possible to take away one from the other. Therefore, in order to make the top number bigger you "Borrow One" from the top of the column to the left. This has the effect of adding 10 to the number at the top of the column you are working in. At the same time, you reduce the number at the top of the column to the left by one. When you click on the Borrow One button, you will see that the above is done automatically. Another method is instead of taking one from the top number of the column to the left, you can add or Pay Back one to the number at the bottom of that column to the left.

 <p>Word Grid...</p><div id="d">How many words can you form with the given letters? In this game you will be given 16 letter tiles, and your task is to form words with 3 to 8 letters within the time limit. You can click a correct number of adjacent letters in vertical, horizontal or diagonal directions, for example "C-A-R-E". An arrow will then appear to link up the letters, and the word "CARE" will be displayed under the grid. You can then click the last letter tile of the word to submit. If the word exists, it will appear on the right of the grid, forming a word list. Then you can start to spell another word and the game continues. Your score will be counted according to the number of words formed and the number of letters in each word; the longer the word, the higher your score. An extra bonus will be awarded if all valid words are formed. The remaining time will be indicated by the timer above the grid. You can use the same letter tile more than once, so try to form as many words as possible before the time runs out. Also be reminded that when you correctly spell a word with 5 or more letters, your word list will be sorted alphabetically, and the number of letters of the words not yet formed will be hinted by spaces, so don't hesitate to form longer, bigger words. Win the game by finding all the words and become a real word game expert!</div>
