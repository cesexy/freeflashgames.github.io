<h4>Game Description:</h4> Rock stars, classical musicians, jazz lovers and enthusiasts of music, are you ready to take the test of music notes? Your task in this game is to play the notes that appear on the staves by using the keyboard. When the game starts, you will be given a keyboard at the bottom of the screen. Music notes on the treble clef will scroll from right to left, and you need to click and play the notes on the keyboard according to the order of appearance. If you hit a wrong note, the note you played will be indicated in red on the corresponding staff. You need to play the correct note again so as to remove it. Starting the game with 5 lives, one life will be deducted if you click a wrong note or cannot play a note before it disappears. If all lives are gone, you lose. As you advance in the game, both the treble clef and the bass clef will appear, and accidentals such as sharps and flats may be added to the notes. Sing along and enjoy the beauty of music!

today's story:

THE FIR TREE

Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.

He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, "Oh, how pretty he is! What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear....</div>
