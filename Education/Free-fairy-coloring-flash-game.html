 <p>Hangman...</p><div id="d">Let's keep away from violence in our peaceful and harmless version of hangman! With the answers collected from the Dolch word list and the lovely graphics, your babies will definitely love it. The object of this game is to find out the hidden words by guessing one letter at a time. You will be given a doll on the right, which has a body composed of 6 rings and a head. On the left of the doll are the 26 alphabets, while the hidden word is represented by a row of dashes which indicate the number of letters. Click an alphabet to make a guess, and the selected letter will be removed from the alphabet list. If the letter is correct, it will be shown on its corresponding position on the dashes and you will receive 10 points. If the letter is not contained in the word, 1 ring will be removed from the doll and 2 points will be deducted. If the whole doll is removed, the current question will be skipped. Let your darlings answer all 10 questions and learn through edutainment!</div>

You can click and drag the tiles to their suitable positions, then click the Submit button under the tiles to check if the word is correct. If the tiles form a valid word, you will be awarded a score based on the amount of time you have spent. If the word does not exist, 2000 points will be deducted. You may click the Hint button on the left of the Submit button to check the meaning of the hidden word, but you will lose 3000 points if you do so. The timer at the lower right corner will show the remaining time for the current question, and when time is up, you may no longer arrange the tiles and the answer will be shown. Accept the challenge of the classic word game now!</div>
