 <p>Make 24...</p><div id="d">Here comes an engaging challenge for poker masters and math geniuses alike - can you compose equations which give 24 by mixing arithmetic signs and brackets with playing cards? At each round of the game you will be given 4 randomly dealt cards, as well as the arithmetic signs of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, plus a pair of brackets. The cards carry numerical values same as their numbers, and A equals to 1, J equals to 11, Q equals to 12 and K equals to 13. Click and drag all of the cards to the blackboard underneath, then click to choose suitable arithmetic signs at the bottom left corner to compose a formula that gives 24. You may rearrange the positions of the components on the blackboard by dragging them. When you have finished the task, click the Submit button at the bottom right corner to check whether the formula is valid. If your formula is not correct, you need to rearrange the components again in order to proceed. Each round you will be given 60 seconds to complete the formula, as indicated by the timer at the top right corner of the blackboard. When time is up, a possible answer will be shown but you will be deducted 3000 points. Transform your hand into equations through arithmetic tricks!</div>

 <p>Lever Phys...</p><div id="d">Be rest assured this is not a clash of titans; it's a fine combination of mathematics and physics. In this game, your goal is to balance the lever by putting all of the given objects onto it. At the start of each level, you will be given a lever which has labels to indicate the distances between the marked positions and the pivot of the lever. The objects and their weights are displayed at the bottom of the screen. You need to click and drag the objects onto the lever until the moments on both sides of the lever are the same, for example, if a 200g item is hanging under the 3m label on the left side, then the moment on the left is 200 x 3; and if on the right side a 300g item is hanging under the 1m label and a 100g item is hanging under the 3m label, then the moment on the right side is 300 x 1 + 100 x 3. In this case, the moments on the two sides are the same and therefore the lever will be balanced. If you have placed an item to an incorrect position, you can click and drag it back to the bottom of the screen. Note that you need to complete each level within the given time limit as shown at the top right corner, or you will lose. As you advance in the game, the number of objects will increase, and the calculation will become more complicated. Play with family and friends and see who can achieve the perfect balance!</div>
