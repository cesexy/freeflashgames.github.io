<h4>Game Description:</h4> The Earth is a noisy planet.  For decades a vast array of signals have been carelessly spreading from our world into the ether.  We're about to find out that other worlds are listening...and in a terrible coincidence one planet has taken offence at the liberties being taken with it's deities.

The denizens of Bingonia have for centuries worshipped their many and varied Gods; Kelly's Eye, One Little Duck and Snakes Alive amongst others.  So when the systems monitoring the skies of Bingonia began picking up signals from a small world at the outer reaches of the galaxy, indicating that the intricate numerology behind the Bingonian beliefs were being used as the basis for a form of primitive gambling, there was only one course of action available; the Bingonians dispatched their elite fighting force, the Bingo Wings, to destroy the Earth - and now only you stand in the Bingonians way!

Destroy the Bingo Wings, collect the Bingo Balls of Doom and break the code to destroy the Bingonian battleships!
