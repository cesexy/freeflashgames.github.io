<h4>Game Description:</h4> The good days are over. The creeps are determined to prepare a campaign against the human race. We;re facing extinction if we don't do something about it. That's where you come in. Prepare your defense against the oncoming waves of creeps. Don't let them complete they're path. Do that by building your base that consist of defense towers along the way. Manage and upgrade them to get to higher levels. SELL some if you need the extra money to upgrade. You have 6 types of towers to chose from once you have enough gold, to use in order to stop 10 different types of creeps attacking in waves. The fragile balance between your revenue, the enemy's resistance, and your tower's strength and upgrades requires planning and creative strategies. Will you be able to handle it all? Will you find an optimal solution? Is there one?! Complete all the levels to be achieve victory and be the God of TD. Good luck!
