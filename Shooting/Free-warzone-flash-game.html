 <p>First Wave...</p><div id="d">ALERT!

Code red! Code red! A batch of bionically enhanced nanobugs have escaped the laboratory in a secret army facility. This is the last chance to defeat them before they escape the confines of the military site and invade the ecosystem. 

Since nanobugs can hardly be seen with regular microscope, the army has prepared a special set of nanoweapons. Your mission is to plant these strategically near the path of your enemy. At the same time you have to mind the budget of the operation. The government will give more money if you're victorious.

THE BASICS

On the right hand side of the screen are inventory and statistics. From here you are able to purchase, sell and update your nanoweapon stock. The statistics tell you how much money you have and how many men you have left before the operation fails. Also there are the statistics and cost for nanoweapons and updating them.

Clicking on the weapon will pop up the statistics: what's the operating radius, how much damage it does and so on. Dragging the weapon on the warzone will show you graphically the radius. After that clicking the weapon on the warzone will seal your purchase. You are also able to choose the weapon after you have placed it and either sell or update it.

On lower part of the right hand side of the screen you have the timer and level counter. Once the timer vanishes completely, a new wave of nanobugs enter the screen. If you are not fast enough you'll end up having multiple waves on the warzone at the same time.

Good luck, soldier, and remember, only the strong survive!</div>
