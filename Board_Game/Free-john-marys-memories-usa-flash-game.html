 <p>Switchback...</p><div id="d">This solitaire card game is played with 2 decks of cards with the K's removed. Initially, 4 aces are dealt to the center as the foundation, and then 12 cards are dealt around them in a circle. The object of this game is to move all the cards to the foundation. The foundation must be built from cards of the same suit in this order: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A. Each time the player should open a card from the stock pile, and then put the card to either the foundation, the circular area, or one of the 4 waste piles. At any time the player can also put a card from the circular area or from the waste piles to the foundation. Each space in the circle can hold only one card. A card from the waste pile can be put to the circular area, but not the other way round. The stock card is dealt only once, but you have one change to press the shuffle button to shuffle the waste cards.</div>
