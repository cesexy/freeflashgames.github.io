 <p>Checkers...</p><div id="d">Checkers game with following rules
A simple move involves sliding a piece one space diagonally forwards to an adjacent unoccupied dark square.
A jump is a move from a square diagonally adjacent to one of the opponent's pieces to an empty square immediately and directly on the opposite side of the opponent's square, thus "jumping directly over" the square containing the opponent's piece. All piece may  jump diagonally forwards and backwards. 
If you can make a jump in your turn then you have to do it !!!
When multiple-option jumping moves are available, whether with the one piece in different directions or multiple pieces that can make various jumping moves, the player may choose which piece to jump with and which jumping option or sequence of jumps to make. The jumping sequence chosen does not necessarily have to be the one that would have resulted in the most captures; however, one must make all available captures in the chosen sequence.</div>

 <p>NOGO 2  (8...</p><div id="d">No Go is a Tic Tac Toe variant on a 8x8 Go game board. Intense strategy added to a simple game play mechanic.

Ideal for fans, teachers, families and friends to battle each other out.

Please note: There are no computer players. This is a party game for 2-4 players!

How to Play NOGO 2:  Play it like Tic-Tac-Toe on a Go board.
For 2-4 Human Players 

Each human player takes a turn and tries to get more 3-in-a-rows than the other players.  

Game is over when all of the internal intersecting lines have a stone on them. 

If you get a 3 in a row without any of your other stones touching, that 3 in a row is worth 3 points. 3 in a rows count in any direction and only one overlap of a 3 in a row counts. Regular 3 in a rows of your own that touch any of your other stones only count as 1 point.

Mouse cursor or touchscreen should work for everything.

For 3-4 player games, turns go clockwise (up, right, down, left, up). These games are more difficult.

This version has been tested on the Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer web browsers.

If you have a touch screen PC or Flash enabled tablet, it is more fun to play that way ;)</div>
