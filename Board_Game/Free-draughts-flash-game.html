<h4>Game Description:</h4> Classic game of draughts (checkers) against the computer.

</div>
						

<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
To move a piece, click once on it and a set of arrows will appear pointing diagonally left and right. You will then find that your mouse pointer will turn into a hand over any vacant square, one space diagonally left or right. If you can take an opponent's draught you will find that your mouse pointer turns into a hand one space beyond them. To move your draught, click on the square you want to move to.

Basic Rules 
The object of draughts is to capture all your opponent's pieces, or to prevent your opponent from being able to move any of their pieces. The game is played on the dark squares of the board only. Two players each have a set of 12 pieces called draughts. You can choose whether to play white or red with red normally going first.

Single pieces may only move diagonally forward one space on any dark square that is not occupied by another draught. To take an opponent's draught, it must be next to yours diagonally and have an empty space in the next square in the same line, so that you literally jump straight over it. The opponent's draught is then removed from the board and will appear at the side as a captured draught. In the standard game, you MUST jump and take an opponent's draught whenever possible (or when the opportunity arises). If after taking a draught you can continue to jump and take more draughts then you must do so. Single draughts can take an opponent's draught only in the forward direction.

When your draught reaches the back line of your opponent's side of the board, that piece is made a King. In my game this is shown as a crown symbol on the draught. Kings can move diagonally forwards and backwards. They can only move one square at a time like a single draught, except when taking, which they can also do, forwards or backwards, diagonally. Single draughts can capture kings.

If you find that you cannot move any of your pieces or you wish to resign then click the Resign button. This will start a new game and add one to your opponent's score.
