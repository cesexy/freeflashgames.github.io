<h4>Game Description:</h4> Laserbox is a challenging strategy. Fire a laser through the box to locate all the mirrors without breaking them. Uncover sections of the box that do not contain a mirror , but be careful! If you clear a section that contains a mirror, it will break!

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
The objective of LaserBox is to detect and avoid uncovering the hidden mirrors within a grid of boxes. To discover mirrors, you must fire a laser into the boxes and note which way the laser is bouncing from within the covered boxes. If you uncover a mirror by accident, the game is over.

To place a laser, click a spot from around the grid of boxes, this will open a menu where you can choose betwe
en "Laser" and "Impulse". "Laser" is a continuous beam that goes from the source, through the grid.

"Impulse" is a short beam that moves slowly throughout the grid. It has a limited flight length. The flight length is determined by the size of a field. The more the size of a field, the can longer fly an "impulse".

Click on the box to mark it as a mirror or to brake it. There are two types of mirrors.  One goes from left top to bottom right, the other goes from right top to bottom left. In addition to selecting a single mirror, you may select multiple mirrors to clear by dragging your mouse.

On the right side of field there is three dials. The first dial shows how far "impulse" has traveled. The second shows how many unmarked mirrors are in the grid. The third shows how long you have been playing for.

So the Ace is the card with the lowest rank, and the king has the highest rank. When you redeal , you are turning the pile of cards upside down to create a new stock pile. Some games allow an unlimited number of redeals, some just one, and other don't allow any redeal of cards. The stock is the pile from where the cards are dealt from. Usually cards are removed from the stock and played to the foundation or waste until the stock is empty. The suit is referring to the type of the cards. There are 4 types: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs. The Hearts and Diamonds are red, and the Spades and Clubs are black. The waste and tableau are other types of piles. The tableau is used to search through the cards for opportunities, and the top card from the waste can be moved to another pile, depending on the type of game.</div>
