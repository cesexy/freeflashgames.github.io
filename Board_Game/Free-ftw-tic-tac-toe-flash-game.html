 <p>Chinese Ch...</p><div id="d">Challenge your mind and try various strategies as you battle with the computer in this traditional board game! Your target is to move all your marbles to the enemy base before your opponent does so. When the game starts, you will be given a checkerboard in the shape of a hexagram, and the board is divided into 6 bases of different colors. The 10 blue marbles on your side are placed in the blue area, while the 10 green pieces of the computer are located in the green base. You and the computer will take turns to make the moves. During your turn, you can click to move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space, or jump over other pieces for consecutive hops. The distance of a jump depends on the number of empty spots between the moving piece and the target piece. For instance, if no empty spot is located between the moving piece and the other piece, then the moving piece can be moved to the first empty space after the other piece on the same straight line; and when an empty spot is located between the moving piece and the other piece, the jumping piece can be moved to the second empty space after the other piece on the same straight line. Note that a piece cannot end its move on the 4 topmost rows of the bases other than its own or its target base, but can jump to it and jump out of it immediately. The available spots for movement are highlighted in red when a marble is selected. When you have finished making the moves, click the moved piece again, and the computer will start to take its turn. Continue the process until you have declared your victory; beware of the computer's aggressive moves or you will lose!</div>
