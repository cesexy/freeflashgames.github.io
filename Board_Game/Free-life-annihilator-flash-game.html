The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

The foundation must be built from cards of the same suit in this order: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A. Each time the player should open a card from the stock pile, and then put the card to either the foundation, the circular area, or one of the 4 waste piles. At any time the player can also put a card from the circular area or from the waste piles to the foundation. Each space in the circle can hold only one card. A card from the waste pile can be put to the circular area, but not the other way round. The stock card is dealt only once, but you have one change to press the shuffle button to shuffle the waste cards.</div>
