<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Two game modes:
1. Annihilation.
Behaviour of cells same as well as in a free mode game simulation.
In this mode, your main objective to put cell in the field so that does not remain live cells.
The there are less than cells you use, the receive more points.

2. Free Mode
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

 <p>Multiplaye...</p><div id="d">This game is played by two people. In this game there will be a board of 8 x 8 squares, the squares will have alternate black and white colours, and each player has 3 rows of pieces put on the black squares. A piece can only move forward, it can either move one step diagonally or capture an opponent piece by jumping over it. In a single move, a piece can jump consecutively to capture multiple opponent pieces. When an opponent piece can be captured, you must capture the opponent piece, i.e. you cannot move without capturing when there are some pieces that you can capture. When a piece reaches the last row, it will be crowned and gains the ability to move backwards. When you capture all the pieces of the other player, you win. You can also win when the opponent cannot make any moves. It is possible that none of the players can force a win, in this case a draw game occurs when both players agree so. Use the mouse to click a piece to move it, the places where it can move to will be highlighted, click the highlighted place to move the piece to its location.</div>
