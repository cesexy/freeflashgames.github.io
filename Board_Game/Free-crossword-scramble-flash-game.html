 <p>Thieves of...</p><div id="d">This game is similar to Forty Thieves Solitaire. The object of this game is to move all the cards to the foundation (upper right piles). The foundation piles are to be built up from A to K with cards of the same suit. You may use the tableau piles (the cards at the bottom) to hold the cards, the tableau piles are to be built down (from K to A) with cards of alternating colours, each time you may move a column of cards at once from one tableau pile to another if that column is arranged correctly, you can only put a K on an empty tableau pile. On the top left are the stock cards, each time you can open one stock card and put it on the waste pile, and then you can move the card to either the foundation piles or to the tableau piles. After you've dealt all the stock cards, you can flip the waste pile and deal again one more time.</div>

At first show an empty field. Then consistently show an arrangement of each dangerous site (on a second on everyone). And already then show, where there is a beacon and the ship. From this point it is possible to conduct the ship.
Management - cliques of a mouse or kursorny keys. The ship can come back to already visited cage some time. Visit of a dangerous site is set off as a mistake only once. It is possible to return and again to come on it, but as a mistake it any more zaschitytaiut.
For each successfully complete round add points. For mistakes fine.
Each round consists of two parts - the main part and a bonus part. In the main part it is necessary to finish the ship to a beacon, having avoided dangerous sites. In a bonus part it is necessary to specify an arrangement of dangerous sites. You will be mistaken once - and all sites are opened, the round comes to an end, points are counted up.
