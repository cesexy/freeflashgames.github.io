<h4>Game Description:</h4> Solitaire Circus can be addictive! Known also as "Patience", Solitaire has existed for centuries and continues to enjoy enormous popularity. Particularly suited to strategic thinkers and the patient alike!

With Solitaire Circus, you try to amount a predetermined number of points by setting cards down on either the target piles or an intermediate pile of cards. 
A card is dealt from the main pile of face down cards and laid on your pile. This card must then be moved to either a target pile or an intermediate pile. On the intermediate piles, cards may only be laid down in an ascending order and alternating colour (e.g. red 10, black 9, red 8, black 7 etc.). 
The target piles must always start with an ace as first card and from then on only cards of the same suit in ascending order may be laid down (e.g. Ace of Hearts, 2 of Hearts etc.). Kings may only be laid down on empty spaces.
If you can't lay a card down from your hand (made up of your intermediate piles), another is dealt from the main pile. Once all cards from the main pile are exhausted, the intermediate pile is turned over and used as the main pile. Already played cards may not be moved without a points penalty. 
If you can't go any further, you always have the possibility of starting a new round, for which there's also a points penalty. Try to always keep a spot free to receive a card. This way, you can always throw away kings and queens and avoid a points penalty.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
1. To accumulate points, turn a card over in the top left of the screen and try to lay this card down on one of the 6 upper or 4 lower stacks of cards.
2. You can only lay cards down on the bottom stacks in ascending number order and in rotating colour order (e.g. red 9, black 8, red 7 etc.). With regards to the upper 4 stacks, only cards of the same suite in ascending order may be laid down (e.g. Ace of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts etc.).
3. You can draw as many new cards as you wish. However, please note that there will be a points penalty applied if you need to turn over the used cards to start again. If you can't make any progress, you can request a new game be started, again against a points penalty.
