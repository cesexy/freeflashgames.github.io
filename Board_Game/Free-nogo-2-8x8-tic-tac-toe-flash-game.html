<h4>Game Description:</h4> No Go is a Tic Tac Toe variant on a 8x8 Go game board. Intense strategy added to a simple game play mechanic.

Ideal for fans, teachers, families and friends to battle each other out.

Please note: There are no computer players. This is a party game for 2-4 players!

How to Play NOGO 2:  Play it like Tic-Tac-Toe on a Go board.
For 2-4 Human Players 

Each human player takes a turn and tries to get more 3-in-a-rows than the other players.  

Game is over when all of the internal intersecting lines have a stone on them. 

If you get a 3 in a row without any of your other stones touching, that 3 in a row is worth 3 points. 3 in a rows count in any direction and only one overlap of a 3 in a row counts. Regular 3 in a rows of your own that touch any of your other stones only count as 1 point.

Mouse cursor or touchscreen should work for everything.

For 3-4 player games, turns go clockwise (up, right, down, left, up). These games are more difficult.

This version has been tested on the Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer web browsers.

If you have a touch screen PC or Flash enabled tablet, it is more fun to play that way ;)
