 <p>Ya! Dice...</p><div id="d">In this game you roll 5 dice and match the result with the patterns to score points. First, you roll 5 dice, and then you can choose to keep a number of dice and roll the rest again, and then do this one more time. After that you can match the final result with one of the patterns, each pattern can only be used once so you need to assign with care. The patterns are: One's - points = sum of 1's in the dice; Two's - points = sum of 2's in the dice; and so on to Six'es; Three of a Kind (3 dice are showing the same face) - points = sum of all dice; Four of a Kind (4 dice are showing the same face) - points = sum of all dice; Full House (a three of a kind and a pair) - points = 25; Small Straight (4 sequential dice) - points = 30; Large Straight (5 sequential dice) - points = 40; Ya! (all 5 dice showing the same face) - points = 50; Chance - points = sum of all dice. After each set of rolls, you must match the result with an unmatched pattern, so it is possible that you score zero for some of the patterns.</div>

 <p>NOGO 2  (8...</p><div id="d">No Go is a Tic Tac Toe variant on a 8x8 Go game board. Intense strategy added to a simple game play mechanic.

Ideal for fans, teachers, families and friends to battle each other out.

Please note: There are no computer players. This is a party game for 2-4 players!

How to Play NOGO 2:  Play it like Tic-Tac-Toe on a Go board.
For 2-4 Human Players 

Each human player takes a turn and tries to get more 3-in-a-rows than the other players.  

Game is over when all of the internal intersecting lines have a stone on them. 

If you get a 3 in a row without any of your other stones touching, that 3 in a row is worth 3 points. 3 in a rows count in any direction and only one overlap of a 3 in a row counts. Regular 3 in a rows of your own that touch any of your other stones only count as 1 point.

Mouse cursor or touchscreen should work for everything.

For 3-4 player games, turns go clockwise (up, right, down, left, up). These games are more difficult.

This version has been tested on the Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer web browsers.

If you have a touch screen PC or Flash enabled tablet, it is more fun to play that way ;)</div>
