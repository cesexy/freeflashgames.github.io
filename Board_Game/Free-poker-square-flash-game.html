<h4>Game Description:</h4> Lovers of poker beware: can you form the best hands by using 25 cards from the deck? At the start of the game, 25 empty spaces are aligned in a 5X5 grid. Then a card from the stock pile on the left is dealt, and you have to decide which space the card will move to by clicking on the target space. The goal of the game is to form the best 10 poker hands both horizontally and vertically. When all of the spaces are filled, you will be given a score based on the hierarchy of the poker hands, rated as follows: Royal Flush 100 points, Straight Flush 75 points, Four of a Kind 50 points, Full House 25 points, Flush 20 points, Straight 15 points, Three of a Kind 10 points, Two Pair 5 points, and One Pair 2 points.

When all the cards in the tableau are used and no more cards can be moved, then you lose the game.</div>
