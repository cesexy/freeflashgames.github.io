 <p>Zmii...</p><div id="d">Zmii is a close relative of the popular 'Snake', but this game is a bit different to a classic one. All
the 'edible' squares on the field have different colors. If you collect 3 of the same color in a row, they
disappear and you get extra points. On the field there are also bonuses that become visible only when
the snake approaches them. Each bonus gives you some advantage in the game:

Cherries add 112 points and change the color of all elements on the field.
Banana adds 56 points.
Pear adds 23 points and speeds up the snake.
Apple adds 23 points and slows down the snake.

There are two game modes: endless, lasting until the snake collides any obstacle, and the levels where
you need to collect a certain amount of points to level up.</div>

 <p>Russian So...</p><div id="d">Russian Solitaire is played with a deck of 52 standard playing cards. The object of the game is to move all cards to the 4 foundations at the top building up in suit. There are 7 tableau piles in this game. At the start of the game, 1 card is dealt face down on the second tableau pile from the left, 2 cards on the third, 3 cards on the fourth, and so on. 1 card is dealt face up on the first tableau pile, while each of the other tableau pile receives 5 cards facing up. Only K can be moved to an empty tableau pile, and building is down by suit. Group of cards can be moved together regardless of sequence long as the move itself is building down a suit. For example, a 9 of spade followed by a 4 of club can be moved together as a group to a 10 of spade.</div>
