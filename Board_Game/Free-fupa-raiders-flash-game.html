So the Ace is the card with the lowest rank, and the king has the highest rank. When you redeal , you are turning the pile of cards upside down to create a new stock pile. Some games allow an unlimited number of redeals, some just one, and other don't allow any redeal of cards. The stock is the pile from where the cards are dealt from. Usually cards are removed from the stock and played to the foundation or waste until the stock is empty. The suit is referring to the type of the cards. There are 4 types: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs. The Hearts and Diamonds are red, and the Spades and Clubs are black. The waste and tableau are other types of piles. The tableau is used to search through the cards for opportunities, and the top card from the waste can be moved to another pile, depending on the type of game.</div>
