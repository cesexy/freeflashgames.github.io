 <p>Mancala...</p><div id="d">This is an ancient board game which dates back to the 6th century AD, and your target is to gather as many pieces of gems in your store as you can. On the game board, 12 small pits are divided into 2 rows, and each of the pits contains 4 pieces of gems. The upper row of pits belongs to the computer, and the lower row is yours. The 2 large pits on the left and right of the board are the stores, with the one on the right belongs to you, and the one on the left belongs to the computer. You and the computer will take turns to move the gems, and each time you may click any of the pits on your row. When a pit is selected, the gems inside will be distributed one by one to the next pits in counterclockwise direction. If the last gem of a move lands on your store, then you can take one more turn by selecting another pit. If the last gem of a move lands on an empty pit on your side while the opposite pit contains gems, then you can capture all of the gems in both pits and put them to your store. The same rules apply to the moves made by the computer. When the pits on one of the rows are emptied, the game ends. The remaining gems on the pits belonging to you will be counted as yours, and those on the pits of the computer will be counted as the computer's. Capture the gemstones with tactics and win prosperously!</div>

 <p>Multiplaye...</p><div id="d">The object of this game is to move all your pegs in the counter clockwise direction until they are all at the lower right region, they can then be removed from the board. The first player to remove all the pegs win. To move the pegs, roll a pair of dice first, the numbers shown on the dice are the number of steps you can move. For example, if 3 and 6 are shown, then you can move one peg three steps, and another peg (or the same peg) 6 steps. If you roll a double, then you can use each die twice, making 4 moves. For example if you roll a double 5, then you can move 4 pegs by 5 steps. You can move your pegs to a column if it is empty or if it is occupied by your pegs, but you cannot move your pegs to columns occupied by 2 or more of your opponent's pegs. If a column is only occupied by 1 of your opponent's pegs, then you can land on this column and knock off the opponent peg. The knocked off peg will have to start from the beginning again. If some of your pegs are knocked off, then you must move them first. You cannot move other pegs unless you no longer have knocked off pegs. You must make as many moves from a roll as possible, for example if you rolled 6 and 3, and you can move 6 or 3 but not both, then you must move 6.</div>
