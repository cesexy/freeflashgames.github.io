<h4>Game Description:</h4> Through 5 scenarios, the Knight seeks his stolen love, imprisoned by the Devil himself. Showcasing a new spin (literally) on the puzzle RPG genre, you must guide your Knight to each level's exit by drilling away the blocks he stands on, and letting gravity take effect! By rotating the entire game board, you can guide him anywhere you wish; into confrontations with the monsters that dwell in the dungeons, or to greedily grab the treasures that litter the game - be careful not to run out of stamina, though! Collect enough currency, and you can buy potions, spells, armour and other trinkets from a shop staffed by a helpful fairy.

3 skill levels cater for absolute beginners, right up to the most hardened strategy fan, 2 different game modes provide essential replayability and a host of achievements await the completist!

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
The aim of each level is to guide your Knight to the stone door, collecting the key on the way. To manoeuvre the Knight you must drill away groups of three or more coloured blocks by clicking on them, causing him to land in the space below. The board can also be rotated by clicking on the arrows either side of it (or by pressing the left or right keys). Enemies can be defeated by removing blocks from above their heads, allowing your Knight to bear down upon them with his Drill. Each monster can attack your Knight in uniquely vile ways; some will lash out if they are next to your Knight, whilst others can attack from a distance, and even rain down death from above. Useful items may occasionally materialise on the board. Collecting these will add them to your inventory (located at the top of the screen) where they can be used at once, or saved for later. If you find yourself unable to make a move, then play will automatically revert to usage of the block switching tool, which allows you to switch any two adjacent tiles in order to form a group of three. Each time you remove some blocks, your action points (represented by the green bar) will reduce. Should you be unfortunate enough that they reach nil, you will start taking damage, so ponder each move carefully, good sir!

Most games are about resource depletion : a resource called health.  Balance of Power is about resource distribution : a resource called influence. The more influence you have the greater your status.  The higher your status the more influence you can take.  The aim is to take all the influence from the enemy. When their influence is gone they will start to see things your way.</div>
