 <p>Reversi...</p><div id="d">Reversi is a strategy board game. Players take turns placing discs on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any discs of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disc just placed and another disc of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of discs turned to display your color when the game ends.</div>

 <p>Presidents...</p><div id="d">Presidents is a card game that is very similar to Uno. The idea is that a person starts off a round by laying down a certain number of cards with the same rank. Once he has done that, the rest of the players need to lay down the same number of cards with a  rank that is equal to or greater than what he has laid down. For example: If a player lays down 2 5's, the other players must lay down 2 5's, 6's, 7's, and so on. There are other rules to the game as well.


-For the first round, the first person to play is the one with the three of clubs, and he lays down that card to begin the game. The next player plays on top of that


-2's are a special exception to the game. They automatically clear a field, and the player to lay one down starts a new round.


-If you lay a card of the same rank as what the previous player played, it skips the next player. If you lay down the third card of the same rank in a row, two players are skipped. If you lay down the fourth and final one in a row, all players are skipped, and you start a new round


-If you play the same rank on doubles, it is your turn again, and you start a new round.


-If you play the same rank and are out of cards, all skips are void, the field is cleared, and the next player starts a new round.


- Once no one can play any cards, the last player to play any cards starts a new round.


-Players receive ranks in the order of President, Vice President, High Scum, and Low Scum as they run out of cards.


-At the beginning of a new round, the President gives the low scum it's two worst cards, and the low scum gives the President it's two best cards. The Vice President and High Scum follow suit with one card. Once all cards are exchanged, the President starts the round.</div>
