 <p>Hostile_Wa...</p><div id="d">Sense of game what to remember, where there are dangerous sites and to carry out the ship on a safe route to a beacon to a beacon.

At first show an empty field. Then consistently show an arrangement of each dangerous site (on a second on everyone). And already then show, where there is a beacon and the ship. From this point it is possible to conduct the ship.
Management - cliques of a mouse or kursorny keys. The ship can come back to already visited cage some time. Visit of a dangerous site is set off as a mistake only once. It is possible to return and again to come on it, but as a mistake it any more zaschitytaiut.
For each successfully complete round add points. For mistakes fine.
Each round consists of two parts - the main part and a bonus part. In the main part it is necessary to finish the ship to a beacon, having avoided dangerous sites. In a bonus part it is necessary to specify an arrangement of dangerous sites. You will be mistaken once - and all sites are opened, the round comes to an end, points are counted up.

COMPLEXITY LEVELS
EASY Paul 4x4. The quantity and an arrangement of enemies is set in a random way but so that the distance between the ship and a beacon was not less than 6 cages (without considering cages on which initially there is a ship and a beacon). From enemies - mines and submarines. That reached a beacon live, 50 points charge. Unmistakably specified all dangerous zones - 50 more.
NORMALPole 5x5. The quantity and an arrangement of enemies is set in a random way, but so that 
the distance between the ship and a beacon was not less than 10 cages (without considering cages on which initially there is a ship and a beacon). From enemies - mines and submarines. Following the results of a round (if it was possible to reach a beacon live) charge 200 points. Unmistakably specified all dangerous zones - 200 more.
HARD Paul 6x6. The quantity and an arrangement of enemies is set in a random way but so that the distance between the ship and a beacon was not less than 15 cages (without considering cages on which initially there is a ship and a beacon). From enemies - mines, submarines and to Ktulkh. Following the results of a round (if it was possible to reach a beacon live) charge 500 points. Unmistakably specified all dangerous zones - 500 more.
