<h4>Game Description:</h4> This solitaire card game is played with 2 decks of cards with the K's removed. Initially, 4 aces are dealt to the center as the foundation, and then 12 cards are dealt around them in a circle. The object of this game is to move all the cards to the foundation. The foundation must be built from cards of the same suit in this order: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A. Each time the player should open a card from the stock pile, and then put the card to either the foundation, the circular area, or one of the 4 waste piles. At any time the player can also put a card from the circular area or from the waste piles to the foundation. Each space in the circle can hold only one card. A card from the waste pile can be put to the circular area, but not the other way round. The stock card is dealt only once, but you have one change to press the shuffle button to shuffle the waste cards.

 <p>Freecell S...</p><div id="d">Let's recall the endless fun of the classic card game! The aim of Freecell Solitaire is to move all cards to 4 foundations by suit from A to K. When the game opens, 52 standard playing cards will be distributed to 8 tableau piles. Each of the four tableau piles on the left will contain 7 upturned cards, while each of the remaining piles will contain 6 upturned cards. 4 reserve cells are located at the top left corner of the screen, while the 4 foundations are located at the top right corner. Each time you can move one card to an empty reserve cell or another tableau pile. Cards on the tableau piles are to be built down in alternating colors, for example, the 6 of hearts can be moved to the top of the 7 of spades or the 7 of clubs. Note that each of the reserve cells can only hold 1 card at a time. An empty tableau pile can be occupied by any card. 500 points will be awarded for each card successfully moved to the foundations, and you will also receive time bonus upon winning the game, so take the bull by the horns in no time!</div>
