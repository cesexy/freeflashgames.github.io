Most games are about resource depletion : a resource called health.  Balance of Power is about resource distribution : a resource called influence. The more influence you have the greater your status.  The higher your status the more influence you can take.  The aim is to take all the influence from the enemy. When their influence is gone they will start to see things your way.</div>

'Goats Versus Tigers' is a very very funny and addictive strategy based game like chess. This is a hunt game between the extravagant Tigers and deceitful Goats.

Here tiger tries to hunt the deer and the deer tries to block the tiger's movement.

Player can play as 'Tigers' or as 'Goats'.

If you are playing as 'Tigers' then you will have 3 tigers. Your goal is to kill 7 goats to win the game. You can kill the Goat by jumping over them to an empty spot. Tiger can not jump over another tiger. Again you have to escape from being trapped. If tigers are fully surrounded by goats and if there is no place to jump then tigers will loose the game.

If you are playing as 'Goats' then you will have 15 goats. Your goal is to block 3 tiger opponents. First of all you have to get all the goats on board. Once all goats are on board then only you can move on the board. If you surround tigers so that there is no empty space for the tiger to jump on then that tiger is blocked.
