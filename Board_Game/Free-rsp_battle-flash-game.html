 <p>Thieves of...</p><div id="d">This game is similar to Forty Thieves Solitaire. The object of this game is to move all the cards to the foundation (upper right piles). The foundation piles are to be built up from A to K with cards of the same suit. You may use the tableau piles (the cards at the bottom) to hold the cards, the tableau piles are to be built down (from K to A) with cards of alternating colours, each time you may move a column of cards at once from one tableau pile to another if that column is arranged correctly, you can only put a K on an empty tableau pile. On the top left are the stock cards, each time you can open one stock card and put it on the waste pile, and then you can move the card to either the foundation piles or to the tableau piles. After you've dealt all the stock cards, you can flip the waste pile and deal again one more time.</div>
