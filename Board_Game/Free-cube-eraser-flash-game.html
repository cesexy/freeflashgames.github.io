At first show an empty field. Then consistently show an arrangement of each dangerous site (on a second on everyone). And already then show, where there is a beacon and the ship. From this point it is possible to conduct the ship.
Management - cliques of a mouse or kursorny keys. The ship can come back to already visited cage some time. Visit of a dangerous site is set off as a mistake only once. It is possible to return and again to come on it, but as a mistake it any more zaschitytaiut.
For each successfully complete round add points. For mistakes fine.
Each round consists of two parts - the main part and a bonus part. In the main part it is necessary to finish the ship to a beacon, having avoided dangerous sites.
