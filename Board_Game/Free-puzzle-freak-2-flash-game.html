 <p>Green Soli...</p><div id="d">Build four stacks of cards, one for each suit, in ascending order, from ace to king. Green solitaire is played with a single deck of 52 cards. The game begins with 28 cards arranged into seven columns. The first column contains one card, the second has two cards, and so on. The top card in each column is face up, the rest are face down.

 <p>Terrace So...</p><div id="d">At the start of this game 11 cards will be dealt as the reserve cards (also known as the terrace) and 4 cards will be dealt to the tableau (the bottom piles). First, you need to decide the base card of the foundation by dragging one of the cards to the foundation (the middle piles). After that, cards will be dealt to the empty tableau and the game starts. The object is to move all the cards to the foundation (built up in alternate colours, wrapping from K to A if necessary). The tableau piles should be built down in alternate colours (also wrapping from A to K if necessary). Emtpy tableau can only be filled by a card from the waste pile (the pile to the right of the covered stock pile). The reserve cards can only be moved directly to the foundation. You can click the stock pile to open a card and put in to the waste pile. When the stock cards are exhausted, you can flip the waste cards and deal again, but this time any card on the waste pile must be used immediately. If there are no valid moves, then the game is over.</div>
