Abel1 (abalone) is a two-player strategy board game in which each player is represented by marbles of opposing colors. The objective is to push six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.
The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces. Play alternates between the players one move at a time, with the red marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a line of one, two or three one space. The move can be either in-line (parallel to the line of marbles) or broadside (not parallel to the line of marbles), as illustrated at right.</div>
