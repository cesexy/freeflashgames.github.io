I've made a little tutorial in the beginning, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out though =)

Use the ARROW-KEYS to MOVE,
A-BUTTON on your keyboard to SHOOT,
and the S-BUTTON to cast a STRONG SPELL.

In order to cast strong spells you have to pick up gems first. Some gems can be combined, some neutralize each other. There are 4 gems: Fire, Earth, Wind and Water.

Here are some tips:
The Green, and the Blue-Green S-Button-Spell will heal you,
The Red one will make you invulnerable.
Using an S-Button spell will make you loose your gems.

 <p>Gourmet's ...</p><div id="d">Gourmet is starving and needs to eat!!!

Legend has it that there grows a tree of magic in the lands of Pebbleton.
Deep into the Forest of Pebbleton Park there is a giant Oak called the 'Candy Tree'. It is said that this tree housed an Elf who spent his day baking away and upon his death the tree was imbued with magical powers to produce an endless supply of nourishments of a sweet nature. But the legend has a dark side. Those who have ventured in search of this tree have never returned. It is said that the famished and ravenous only wanting to eat the best of the dropping sweets shall get too fat to ever move again, while those whom eat the vilest sweets shall become too thin and fall into an endless sleep.

Gourmet has taken it upon himself to venture into the perilous park of Pebbleton and face the many dangers presented to him in search for the magical Oak. Traveling through vast fields of green, crossing large bodies of waters, and scaling treetops, Gourmet journeyed for what seemed to be a lifetime into this perilous park inhabited by humans, and through cunning whit and stealth, he achieved victory in his quest to find the legendary Candy Tree. Now, hungry and tired, he will reap the rewards of his long lasting journey with the endless supply of nourishments that fall from this tree, and they are all for him. But beware!

Take control of Gourmet as he now begins his real mission, to enjoy the various nourishments dropped from the candy tree but watch what you eat or Gourmet will end up in trouble.</div>
