Story
A boy named Nerd headed out of Happy Town unknowing to him he was entering the town of Halloween Night a town filled with monsters and magic. 

He was about a few minutes in town and that's when it happened, he heard a loud sound. He started to run without looking until he ram into someone! 

It was a werewolf! The Nerd screamed and turned around only to find a vampire sneaking up on him, as he was about to be controlled by the vampire's gaze. 

A witch flew past the vampire and grabbed the Nerd. The Nerd kicked and screamed! And at last was able to push away from the witch and fell into a lagoon. 

Then a fish monster tried to eat him.  But before he did the Nerd dodged and started to run as fast as he could. He was somewhere in the center of town when he saw a CD just floating there. He felt a force pulling him to it. This was the same feeling he had when woke up today. 

It was calling him. The monsters were now around him and before they could get him, he took the CD and it brought out a light that made all the monsters fade into the CD.
