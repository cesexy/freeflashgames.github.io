Story:
A boy named Nerd headed out of Happy Town unknowing to him he was entering the town of Halloween Night. A town filled with monsters and magic. As he headed past the sign that read GO BACK!

He was about a few minutes in town and that's when it happened! The sky grew darker and from every turn were shadows! The Nerd grew scared and started to run wishing he never came here because he didn't know why he came?

As he ran he could see Zombies, and Ghosts. He ran so fast he hit in to some big green monster known as the Dr. Monster. Yelling in fear he jumped over him and took off.

After he ran for a while he made a stop to see where he was. He found him self lost! And then he heard a loud sound. He turned and again he heard the loud sound. He then heard it again but this time it sounded more like a roar!

He started to run again without looking until he ran into someone! It was a werewolf! the Nerd screamed and ran into a tomb to find a Sleeping Mummy and behide him a vampire sneaking up to him. As he was about to be controled by the vampire's gaze.

He ran away seeing a small light. He ran to it leaving him outside once again, that's when A witch flew past the Nerd laughing and laughing! The Nerd kicked and screamed! as he ran making a stop by a lagoon that's when a Monster jumped out of the Lagoon.

As the Lagoon monster jumped all the nerd's clothes were filled with green ooze. He started to ring his clothes out but as he did he heard a sound from behind. It was a Lagoon Monster about to grab him.

But before he did the Nerd dodged and started to run as fast as he could. He found himself in a Pumpkin Field that's when he saw a man, but not like any man this man had a Pumkin for his Head...He threw his head at the nerd making the nerd have to run faster and faster to out run it.

That's when he fell into a deep hole. As he fell he could see all the monsters that he met before falling with him going into the deep... deep ground.

When he made impact with the ground he felt like he was shielded by a magic defense but not taking any chances he ran inner.

That's when he saw that he was at a dead end. There was nonthing here only a CD and The only way out he could see was up from him, but He saw all the monsters he
met starting to Surround him. That's when the Nerd started to yell for help and that's when The Cd behide him started to spin and Tremble that's when a big bursts of light shot out.

Pulling every monster to the CD, after the light faded all the monsters were gone.
He started to feel like he was being pulled to the CD like it were calling him. That's when the CD started to talk to the nerd in his head. Saying I have been waiting for you, pick me up and lets save this world!

The Nerd now knew why he came to this town It was calling him. This is why he came here in the first place.

As he Grabbed the CD he could feel a magic shock to his whole body, the nerd smiled and started to exit this unknow place. That's when he found him self in the middle of town and a group of monsters starting around him. That's when he knew deep down inside. This was going to be the start of a quest he wouldn't forget!</div>
