 <p>Downing St...</p><div id="d">Downing Street Fighter is using the concept provided by Street Fighter of fighting a hierarchy of enemies to achieve champion status and turning it on its head. Instead, of fighting to be champion, you are fighting for the freedom of the British people. As the looming General Election of 2010 is almost here and the public still knows nothing of what any of the three parties stand for, it is certainly a novel idea and one that is rather poignant. 


 Created by the leading UK based games design and development team at Tentacle, the game is of a high quality and is completely unique. There are no bugs and glitches in the game at all so you can just get on and play very quickly and very easily. 


 Tentacle designed, developed and produced this game in response to the hottest issue in the British news at the moment, or rather the hottest question - who will be the next Prime Minister? Given the way the polls are fluctuating, nobody knows but that does not mean that the people cannot have a little fun along the way! Tentacle is renowned for its production of virals based on topical and controversial news stories and so Downing Street Fighter fits the bill well. 


 As a reputable company, Tentacle will only ask for relevant information from individual players to register high scores, enable communication and other similar activities that are made transparent on the site. No further information will be requested at all and no details collected will be used in any way, shape or form outside of the game format and service. As such, you can play the game with peace of mind that all that is required from you is a little imagination and fun!

goto tbsw.wikispaces.com
for cheats in this game.
you can enter cheats in the blue platform (near the beginning).

the game is what you make it and was fun to make, i made this is one week of 4 hours of sleep a day ... so i am really tired (jul/17/08)

oh and if you see any glichs with the platformas (geting stuck in them) use it to your advantage , as i am not going to change it.
and the hp bar thing... may not work because it has almost 500 lines of code running 60 times every sec. and the hp bar is the last thing to update and somtimes it doesnt get updated if alot of things are going on.

enemys have a max speed , but not hp. get enough kills and the ground and weapon placement changes (onice at 30 kills and another time at 100 kills)

oh and there are nine weapons!!!!!
revolver
shotgun
fireman's axe
