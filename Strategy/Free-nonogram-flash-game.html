<h4>Game Description:</h4> Can you solve the challenging Japanese pixel puzzle through abstract logical thinking? In this game, your goal is to reveal the hidden picture based on the hints. You will be given a grid which is divided into 20 columns and 17 rows of small squares, as well as two rulers provided for your reference. The numbers outside the grid indicate the number and color of connected squares in a row or a column, for example, a hint of 3-2-5 in green color shows that groups of 3, 2 and 5 green squares are present. You may highlight the squares according to the hints so as to reveal the picture. To do so, click to select a color on the right of the grid, then click and drag the corresponding squares on the grid. To label an empty square, click the cross button above the color panel, then click and drag the related squares. If you would like to remove the colors or markings on some squares, you may click the blank button above the cross button, then click and drag the corresponding squares. Your score will be counted down from 50000 at the top right corner, so reveal the whole image as quickly as you can and battle your way to the top!

 <p>Heroic Ant...</p><div id="d">The rumor is that the world outside of the ants' colony is beautiful, boundless, and it gives plentiful food. The ants are so excited that they wish they could reach the blue sky, but at the same time they are also worried about the pesticides widely spread by humans. A little ant, our hero, has volunteered to be the explorer, so as to gather more information for the expansion of the colony. In order to help the little ant to travel a longer distance, its fellows have constructed a leaf sling, so that the little ant can be sent further. Your goal in the game is to help the little ant to reach the distant lands by controlling the launching angle and power of the leaf sling. When the game starts, the little ant will be sitting on the leaf. Click and drag the string to set the launching angle and power, as indicated by an arrow-shaped power gauge appearing on the right of the sling. When you are satisfied with the settings, you can release the mouse button and the ant will be thrown. The ant will stay in mid-air for a while before hitting the ground, and you can use the 2 power-ups displayed at the top left corner to help the ant to reach further distance. Click the pair of wings and the ant will fly upward for a few seconds, while the morning dew will give full rebounds when the ant hits the ground. When the ant is traveling, it will encounter a number of helpful plants, as well as some harmful insects and objects. The ant can bounce higher if it meets a flower or a mushroom, and the falling leaves in mid-air will carry the ant for a while. But if the ant bumps into a bee or a butterfly in the air, both of them will fall onto the ground. When the ant crashes into dirt, part of its force will be absorbed and it will slow down. And if the ant hits a pebble or a mantis on the ground, it will faint. The traveling distance of the ant will be recorded at the bottom right corner. The ant can no longer travel when it has lost all of his power, and the total distance will be shown. Then the next throw will start and the game continues until all 5 throws are completed. The farthest distance that the ant has traveled will be displayed at the top right corner. Send the little ant afar and let it explore new possibilities!</div>
