 <p>Bee Empire...</p><div id="d">Your majestic empire has long enjoyed its peace and prosperity, with rich resources and well-constructed colonies spreading all over the realm. But your ambitious neighbor, the kingdom of hornets, is casting the greedy eyes on your homeland. Hordes of fierce soldiers are sent to invade your empire with only one goal: to seize and colonize the land. You need to save the day by growing your army and expelling the malicious intruders. When the game starts, larvae will slowly grow one by one at the bottom left corner of the screen. Above the larvae you can find a selection panel, which contains 3 types of bees for you to breed. The one at the top is the soldier which defends against the enemies; the one in the middle is the worker bee, which can increase the incoming amount of resources (honey, of course); and the one at the bottom of the panel is the drone, which breeds and increases the birth rate of the larvae. Each type of the bees requires a specific amount of resources to grow. you can click the corresponding icon on the panel to grow a bee. The current incoming rate of resources is shown at the top of the screen, while the birth rate of larvae is displayed on the bottom right. When a wave of hornets is coming, a timer will appear on the right of the screen, indicating the remaining seconds for your preparation. When the enemies arrive, they will start attacking the members of your empire. The members will be eliminated when they are under violent attacks, but you can continuously grow new members during the battle. If your soldiers are all defeated, the hornets will reach the beehive at the top left corner of the screen and attempt to destroy it, and if the hive is completely broken, you lose the game. If a wave of intruders is eliminated, the hornets will temporarily cease fire, but will soon come back with a larger and stronger legion. After 9 rounds of violent waves, the queen hornet will join the final battle, and you need to defeat her in order to declare victory. Eliminate the demons and return peace to your beloved empire!</div>
