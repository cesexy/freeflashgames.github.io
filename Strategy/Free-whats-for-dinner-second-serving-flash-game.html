 <p>Slate Circ...</p><div id="d">Slate Circle is a text-based strategy game that you have to remove the last slate circle to win. Can you remove the last slate circle?

There are 30 slate circles. When it is your turn, you can remove either 1, 2, or 3 slates. The person who removes the last slate wins. Think before you choose because this game is all about strategy. Good luck.

Slate Circle was a game concept I had since 2008. It was supposed to be a mini game in a major game. However, I have not had any ideas for a big game that I can include this mini game. So I have decided to release this game as a standalone game.

Anyway, please play the game, and I hope you enjoy it. Please leave comments, feedbacks, and constructive criticisms on the game's Newgrounds page, http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/540263. Thank you.
