 <p>The Maze G...</p><div id="d">Steady hand is a must if you want to succeed in this maze. Small movements are needed with high precision and accuracy. By the start of the game you are given instructions to drag the pointer onto a green box. A big slanted yellow arrow will be pointing at it but will disappear at the instance the pointer is placed. The image is then replaced by an irregular shaped maze that is set on a black background. The mouse arrow changes into a hand pointer. The green box that you have dragged into will be the starting point of the maze. The gray maze is very simple at first, as you see a wide road to the end point. The green box will now be placed at that point. Your objective is to get to the end of the maze without having to touch any black areas of the maze. If you do, however, accidentally dragged the mouse outside the gray path, a single touch on the black pixel will finish the game and you will have to restart. The maze gets longer and narrower as your level increases. You will need to focus on the point of the finger because the hand itself will not be penalized if it goes out of bounds.</div>

 <p>Silver Maz...</p><div id="d">A deep tower defense game featuring 31 unique turrets, customization, and tower combinations!

This is a big repolishiment/remake of my first game, Snow Virus TD.  I guess I could call it a sequel, all maps have been changed or severely rebalanced ;)
The game can be very complex. Each one of the 31 towers has a use ;).

There is also an enchant system designed for you to abuse and exploit. The lightning enchant for instance adds extra area damage when the enemies are hit. Use that enchant with an area damage tower, and every creep hit by that bullet will also strike everyone nearby.

The (minimal) plot remains the same:

"An evil AI has taken over the military forces of a space colony. Arm your defenses and protect your base before being overrun by all those pesky fiends!"

I hope you guys enjoy it!</div>
