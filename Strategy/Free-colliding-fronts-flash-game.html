<h4>Game Description:</h4> Colliding Fronts is tower defense game inspired by World War II theme. Aggressive German troops are trying to break through weak front lines. You must prepare and repel incoming forces. Defense asks some logics, so its healthy for your brains !

Main features:

    The game consists of 10 levels. Game difficulty increases as you progress through levels.
    There are 7 different bunkers, AA batteries, turrets to build based on WW2 military.
    Upgrading system has a very unique approach, where you spend money on upgrading tower damage, range and reload speed.
    To make things even more interesting there are 3 supporting buildings, which increase effectiveness of nearby towers. This makes game strategy a bit more advanced.
    Colliding Fronts has very rich particle, projectile and decal variety, which adds a lot of dynamic to it.
    To add even more dynamic to the game, sounds for every tower, collision are very polished and different from each other.
    One of the background features include automatic and manual game optimisation for better user experience even with a slower computer.
    13 different enemy unit types:

Prepare to slay down various enemy soldiers, from fast assault grunts to slow ultimately strong guys with panzerschreks. Your "hot potato" cannons should be aiming at Panzer III, Panther, Tiger and even unique Maus tanks! While anti-air guns should not count crows in the sky any more, because enormous zeppelin accompanied by Luftwaffes is coming.

    And many more features that make user experience as entertaining and easy as possible.


All in all units are:

    4 types of infantry
    2 transport armored vechicles
    4 panzers
    3 planes and bombers.
