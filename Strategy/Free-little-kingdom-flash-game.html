 <p>Hex Mines...</p><div id="d">Can you sweep the mines away without detonating any of them? In this minesweeper game with hexagonal tiles, your goal is to reveal the tiles and find out the 10 mines underneath. The game opens with multiple covered tiles in hexagonal shape, and you may click any of the tiles to reveal it. If you have revealed a mine, the game ends, and you may click the Restart button at the top of the screen to play again. If the revealed tile does not contain a mine, a number will appear on the tile, indicating the total number of mines in the adjacent tiles. If an area does not contain any mines, the tile will be blank and the whole area will be revealed. You may then use the information to deduce the locations of the 10 mines. If a tile contains a mine according to your guess, you may press Shift on your keyboard and click the mouse simultaneously to flag the tile. Simply repeat this step if you would like to remove a flag. You win the game when all mines are found. Note that when you make your very first move, the scoreboard at the top left corner will start to count down, and when it reaches zero, you can receive no points even the task is completed.
