**Note** It glitches sometimes when the game is over. If it doesn't go to the high scores page after the game ends, right-click and click Forward (you can do this at any point in the game if you want to submit your score without finishing.) If you discover any more bugs/glitches, please either PM me, or leave a comment with them. Also, when you get into the high levels, it tends to lag. This is something I don't know how to fix, so you will just have to deal with it.</div>
