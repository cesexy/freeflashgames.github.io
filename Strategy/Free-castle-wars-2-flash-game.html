 <p>Slate Circ...</p><div id="d">Slate Circle is a text-based strategy game that you have to remove the last slate circle to win. Can you remove the last slate circle?

There are 30 slate circles. When it is your turn, you can remove either 1, 2, or 3 slates. The person who removes the last slate wins. Think before you choose because this game is all about strategy. Good luck.

Slate Circle was a game concept I had since 2008. It was supposed to be a mini game in a major game. However, I have not had any ideas for a big game that I can include this mini game. So I have decided to release this game as a standalone game.

Anyway, please play the game, and I hope you enjoy it. Please leave comments, feedbacks, and constructive criticisms on the game's Newgrounds page, http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/540263. Thank you.

 <p>Tower Defe...</p><div id="d">Defend outer space from enemy spaceships. This is a simple tower defence game. You know the drill: buy and upgrade towers, kill enemies, get to the finish. The game gets progressively harder, and there are 100 levels.
**Note** It glitches sometimes when the game is over. If it doesn't go to the high scores page after the game ends, right-click and click Forward (you can do this at any point in the game if you want to submit your score without finishing.) If you discover any more bugs/glitches, please either PM me, or leave a comment with them. Also, when you get into the high levels, it tends to lag. This is something I don't know how to fix, so you will just have to deal with it.</div>
