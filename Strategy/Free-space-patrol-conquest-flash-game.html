 <p>Pyramid So...</p><div id="d">Can you accomplish the task given by the Pharaoh? Your goal in this game is to remove all cards on the pyramid by pairing the cards which give a sum of 13 points regardless of their suits. The rankings of the cards are as follows: J has 11 points, Q has 12 points, K has 13 points, A has 1 point, and the remaining cards carry points according to their numbers, for example, a 7 carries 7 points. When the game opens, 28 upturned cards are distributed into 7 rows in the shape of a pyramid. 1 upturned card is dealt to the discard pile under the pyramid, while the remaining downturned cards are put to the left of the discard pile as the stock pile. You can click to remove any pair of cards on the pyramid or the discard pile that gives the sum of 13, for example A and Q, 10 and 3, while a K can be removed by itself. Note that cards on the pyramid cannot be removed when other cards are placing on top of them. When no moves are available, click the stock pile and get a new card. Count your steps wisely, dismiss all cards and win the game!</div>
