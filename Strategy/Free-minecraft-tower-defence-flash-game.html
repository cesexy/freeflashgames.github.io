<h4>Game Description:</h4> Minecraft Tower Defense is a tower defense game with ideas taken from mobs and items from Minecraft, by Mojang. It is is no way affiliated with them and it is recommended you go play their game before trying this. I have been working on completely remaking the game to be more awesome, with crafting and enchanting and all sorts of stuff, and Flash has finally decided the file is too large! Now, to work on it I would have to publish it after every edit, change some properties by hand outside of flash, and then run it, and repeat for every bug and feature I fix/find/add.

Soooo..... Here is version 2.9, not quite 3.0. I'm now working on some other games, right now one called Ink Runner. I may eventually come back to this and remake it with more thrifty coding (I know a lot more now than I did when I started this project), but that will take a long time, so enjoy this version, which doesn't have potions, a shop, a storyline, lava/water, map-specific graphics, flint/steel, or multiplayer; all things I wanted to add. Either way, it's a lot better than 2.7, so enjoy!
