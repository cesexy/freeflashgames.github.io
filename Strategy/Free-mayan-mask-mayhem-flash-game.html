 <p>Heroic Ant...</p><div id="d">The rumor is that the world outside of the ants' colony is beautiful, boundless, and it gives plentiful food. The ants are so excited that they wish they could reach the blue sky, but at the same time they are also worried about the pesticides widely spread by humans. A little ant, our hero, has volunteered to be the explorer, so as to gather more information for the expansion of the colony. In order to help the little ant to travel a longer distance, its fellows have constructed a leaf sling, so that the little ant can be sent further. Your goal in the game is to help the little ant to reach the distant lands by controlling the launching angle and power of the leaf sling. When the game starts, the little ant will be sitting on the leaf. Click and drag the string to set the launching angle and power, as indicated by an arrow-shaped power gauge appearing on the right of the sling. When you are satisfied with the settings, you can release the mouse button and the ant will be thrown. The ant will stay in mid-air for a while before hitting the ground, and you can use the 2 power-ups displayed at the top left corner to help the ant to reach further distance. Click the pair of wings and the ant will fly upward for a few seconds, while the morning dew will give full rebounds when the ant hits the ground. When the ant is traveling, it will encounter a number of helpful plants, as well as some harmful insects and objects. The ant can bounce higher if it meets a flower or a mushroom, and the falling leaves in mid-air will carry the ant for a while. But if the ant bumps into a bee or a butterfly in the air, both of them will fall onto the ground. When the ant crashes into dirt, part of its force will be absorbed and it will slow down. And if the ant hits a pebble or a mantis on the ground, it will faint. The traveling distance of the ant will be recorded at the bottom right corner. The ant can no longer travel when it has lost all of his power, and the total distance will be shown. Then the next throw will start and the game continues until all 5 throws are completed. The farthest distance that the ant has traveled will be displayed at the top right corner. Send the little ant afar and let it explore new possibilities!</div>

 <p>DEMOGORGON...</p><div id="d">The human world rejoiced at the disappearance of the entire Demogorgon genealogy. It was impossible to fathom that this rejoicing would come to a fag-end, the previous battle was a victory worth cherishing for time immemorial. Underworld master of the demons, Demogorgon's anger has broken all hell lose. Demogorgon was believed to be dead, but he is immortal as he has multiple bodies. The underworld has broken all the embargos and is charging towards human kind for the re-entitlement of the world's supremacy. The previous defeat has infected the demons with more terror, something that the mankind may not be able to pursue.
Demogorgon's forces were able to infiltrate other dark havens in the universe and have introduced powerful enemy units to tackle the human sorcery. The reign of human apogee is still unknown; the heroes of the previous battle are the only hope to perturb the motion of these monsters.</div>
