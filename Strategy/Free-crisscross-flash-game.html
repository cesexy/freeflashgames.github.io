<h4>Game Description:</h4> There are only two General Beings in the world. Nobody knows how this all started, but from time immemorial they didn't get on and divided the land in equal parts in order not to bother each other. Once upon a time, one of them, who called himself The Different, divided into great number of small pieces and began a large-scale attack on the unprepared opponent, making him draw back to the border of his former possession. Still, our hero managed to pick up form an unexpected attack and had time to split himself apart too. Now, only tactics and faith will help him to return the things that belong to him legally.
