 <a href="Free-animal-olympics-diving-flash-game.html" title="Play Animal Olympics - Diving free flash game."><img src="http://games.mochiads.com/c/g/animal-olympics-diving/_thumb_100x100.png" alt="Animal Olympics - Diving" width="100" height="100"></a>
 <p>Animal Oly...</p><div id="d">Join the Animal Olympics and seize the gold in 10m Platform Diving! In this game you will play as the penguin representing the Penguin Kingdom to compete in the final of the diving competition. Your opponents include beaver, frog, seal, otter and kingfisher, and your goal is to beat these contestants by performing the best jumps in a total of 5 rounds. To ensure fairness, the contestants are only allowed to perform groups 1 to 4 in tuck (C) position and group 5 in free (D) position. The game begins with the penguin walking to the edge of the platform, and you can choose backward or forward as the jumping direction by clicking the corresponding icon. If you have selected a direction but would like to change your mind, you can click the other icon to choose the other direction. When you have made your choice, click the Dive button at the bottom, and the penguin will prepare to jump. A vertical power gauge will be shown on the screen, indicating the power of the jump. To set the power, simply click the mouse or press any key on your keyboard when the red line moves to the desired position. Then another guage in the shape of a sector will appear on the right of the power gauge, indicating the angle of the jump. Click the mouse or press any key on your keyboard to set the angle, and the penguin will perform the jump. The height and distance of the jump are determined by the jumping direction and angle. If the jumping direction and angle are set to the extreme, the penguin will hit the platform and become dizzy, resulting in an epic failure. If the jump is successful, the penguin can perform special tricks in the air before reaching the water. You can press the up or down arrow key on the screen or on your keyboard to perform a flip, or hit the left or right arrow key for a twist. Note that once a flipping or twisting direction is chosen, you will not be allowed to flip or twist in an opposite direction, for example, when you have pressed the down arrow key to perform a forward flip, you will not be allowed to perform a backward flip. It is also impossible to perform flip and twist at the same instance, therefore you need to release the arrow keys for flip or twist before performing another trick. When the penguin reaches 5m above the water, a blinking Spacebar will appear at the upper part of the screen, hinting the entry. Press the Spacebar on your keyboard, and the penguin will extend its arms forward and prepare for the entry. The flip and twist buttons on the screen will be removed, and another blinking Spacebar will appear at the upper part of the screen, hinting the suppression of water splash. Press the Spacebar on your keyboard again so that the splash can be minimized. After the dive is completed, each of the 5 judges will give you a score within the range of 0.0 to 10.0 based on the jump and the entry. The highest and the lowest scores will be eliminated, while the remaining 3 will be summed and multiplied by the Degree of Difficulty (DD) based on actual diving. The penguin will be delighted if the average score is not lower than 7.0, but it will be disappointed if the average score is lower than 7.0. The current score and rank of each contestant will be displayed on the leaderboard after each round. Upon the completion of all 5 rounds, the penguin will stand on the podium if it has won a medal. If the penguin receives no medal, you lose. Showcase your flawless jumps and spectacular movements to become the laureate!</div>
