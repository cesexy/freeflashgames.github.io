<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
PENALTY SHOOTOUT GAME RULES

Objective : Your objective is to score more goals than your opponent from the penalty spot. Each player gets to shoot and defend against 5 penalty shots. The shooting and defending is done taking turns for each opponent (1st penalty shot you control the striker and your opponent controls the goalkeeper, 2nd penalty shot you control the goalkeeper and your opponent the striker and so on and vice versa).

Sudden Death : If no player wins after the 5 penalty shots, a "Sudden Death" round starts, in which the players shoot one penalty shot each. The sudden death round end only when one of the two players manages to score a goal and at the same time successfully defend against his/her opponent's shot.

Controls : The game is played by clicking on one of the six arrows that appear on the six predetermined areas of the goal. If you don't select an area within 6 seconds, the system selects a random area for you. That is regardless of whether you shoot or defend at the time.

Score keeping : a)The goals scored are represented as a green ball in the scoreboard, while saves are represented as a red ball. The overall score is also presented as a number for example 1 - 0. b) Best of 3 or 5 matches option: In case this option has been selected when creating/joining the game, the winner is declared after the predetermined 3 or 5 matches are played. To win a "Best of 3" game you need to win 2 matches, while on a "Best of 5" game you need to win 3 matches. The matches you have won are represented as golden on the scoreboard.

Re - Match : If you want to challenge your opponent to a re-match, you can click on the "Request a re-match" button appearing at the end of the game. In case your opponent accepts, a game with the same settings is created. If you don't propose a re-match or your opponent rejects your rematch, then both players are directed to the lobby at the end of the countdown.

Quit : If you opt to quit the game at any moment, your opponent is automatically declared the winner and you lose the wager placed.

Sound : You can turn the in-game sound effects and music on or off by clicking on the speaker icon at the lower right corner (next to the chat area).

You will be controlling a kiwi in the game, and your goal is to jump as far as possible in 3 attempts. When the game starts, the kiwi will be ready on the field. You need to press the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard alternatively for the kiwi to run, press the up arrow key to jump, and hold the up arrow key to set the jumping angle. When you are holding the up arrow key, a power gauge will appear on the screen, and you can release the key when the jumping angle is suitable, so that the kiwi will jump and land on the sand pit. Then the distance of the jump will be displayed, and the referee will determine whether the jump is foul or not by referring to the camera record. A white flag will be raised if the jump is clean, while a red flag will be shown and the jump will be forfeited if the kiwi has stepped on the takeoff line. Then the kiwi will return to the field and completes the remaining attempts. The current best distance will be displayed at the top right corner of the screen. After all 3 attempts are completed, the kiwi will receive a medal if its result is good enough. Can you lead the kiwi to glorious victory?</div>
