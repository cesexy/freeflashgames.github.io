<h4>Game Description:</h4> Play in three leagues of Five-A-Side football in this game with Amateur being the easiest and Professional the hardest.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
On the opening screen you have three button choices, Amateur, Semi-Pro and Professional. These are the three leagues of Five-A-Side football you can play in this game with Amateur being the easiest and Professional the hardest. Clicking any of these buttons will take you to the Choices screen. 

Choices screen 
Here you can choose the time limit for your game by clicking one of the circles next to the time you want. The times shown are full times so 2 minutes will be 1 minutes for each half. By default the check mark is set to 10 minutes. After you have chosen your time, choose a team colour to play in by clicking either the red or white shirt. Clicking either of these buttons will take you to the match screen.

Match screen 
In the first half of the game you play from right to left. Your score is shown at the top of the screen in the colour you are playing in i.e. white or red. You will find that your mouse pointer has been replaced by a yellow circle. To move your players, left click only once at the start of the match and then move the yellow circle over any of your team and then in the direction that you want them to run, normally towards the ball. No other control is required as when your player touches the ball it will be kicked. For a power shot, make sure the ball and your player are in the yellow circle and click the left mouse button. When you score a goal in the one you are kicking towards, the action will be frozen and a button will appear in the centre. Click it to continue. After you have scored, the computer team will start after you have clicked this button. They also start after half time which will be shown on the clock at the top of the screen which is set to the time you selected on the Choices screen. The time shown counts down from the time selected i.e. if you chose 2 minutes, each half is one minute and the clock counts down to zero from that. In the second half, play is reversed so you are playing to score in the goal on the right.
