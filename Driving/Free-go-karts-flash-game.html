<h4>Game Description:</h4> Race your Blue Go Kart against the Computer's Red one.

</div>
						

<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
On the opening screen click the dot next to the number of Laps you want to do and then click on the button corresponding to the level of opponent you require. There are three levels of opponent - Novice, Semi Pro and Pro - each one driving faster than the one before. 

To win the game you have to get round the track and finish the number of laps you selected before the Computer Red Kart does. You can move your Kart when the Countdown has reached Green. The number of Laps completed is shown in the top left hand corner of the screen for your Kart. Each lap is timed against the clock for each car and this is displayed in the top left corner next to your Lap number. Next to that is your best overall lap time for this game and this is used for Best Lap Times leader board. If you have an overall lap time which is faster than any of the top ten in the leader board, you will be asked your name if you click the "Click Here For Best Lap Times" button displayed at the end of the game. All the laps, times etc., for the Red Kart are shown on the right side of the screen.

Controlling The Blue Kart 
To control the Blue Kart you use the Arrow Keys on your keyboard. The Up arrow is used to increase speed and does not need to be pressed all the time throughout the game. To slow down or brake tap the Down arrow key. To turn the car to the right, press the Right arrow and left, the Left arrow. Remember, when your Kart is facing down, your left and right changes.

You can bump into the tyre walls or hay bails at anytime without damaging your Kart but your car will bump and spin causing a brief loss of control. Colliding with the Red Kart will also cause a bump and spin action and can sometimes cause an oil spill. Driving over an oil spill can cause your Kart to spin, also with a brief loss of control.
