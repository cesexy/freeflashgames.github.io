<h4>Game Description:</h4> Once upon a time, there was a mighty powerful King who ruled the world wisely and justly. The gods were so pleased that they gifted him with the "Key of Destiny", "Apples of Health", "Chalice of Youth", "Black diamond" and "Gurdian Angel".

Seeing his power, the devil got scared and challenged the King into playing a game of chess, winning which he would get to rule the other worlds too, loosing, he will forfeit all his gifts.

One by one, the king lost the gift and eventually sold his soul to the devil.

The devil turned the king into a chess piece and locked him on a board. Each of his gifts were hidden on the board guarded with the devils evil slaves.

To escape, the king has to get his gifts one by one till he has enough power to face the devil.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
OnThe king is now the knight on a chess board. He has to follow the chess rule.

The knight can only move 3 columns in an "L" shape exactly like how it is on a chess board. 

The objective is to get the key which is placed somewhere on the board and reach the "Gate" at the end of the board. The knight can go either forward or backward. He will get points according to the number of rows he jumped forward.

He will also loose points if he goes backward. The knight can play as long as he has health. If the health reaches 0, he is dead. The same level can be restarted but all the gifts he regained will be lost again.

Knights health is reduced if he steps on the "poison pot", or "the bomb".
Both "poison pot" and "bomb" reduces health by 10. 

If the knight steps on the "Bomb" then his health is reduced and if he has already got the "Key of Destiny" he looses it and is placed somewhere on the board. If he has not already got the "Key of Destiny" then its place on the board is shuffled to a new place

If the knight steps on the "Fire from hell", he looses one of his "Chalice of Youth" if he has got it. If not, then his health is reduced by 10.

If the knight steps on the "Scarab", then he looses one of his "Guardian Angel" if he has got it. If not, then he looses one of his "Chalice of Youth" if he has got it". If not, then his health is reduced by 10.

If the knight steps on the "Spider" then he looses one of his "Black Diamond" if he has got it. If not, then he looses one of his "Guardian Angel" if he has got it.

If not, then he looses one of his "Chalice of Youth" if he has got it. If not, then his health is reduced by 10.

If the knight steps on the "Devil" then he looses everything he has, and his health is brought down to 10. If this happens, then the knight has to play very carefully again trying to collect the key and other possible gifts to reach the gate.

If the knight collects an apple, his score and health increase. His score increases by 10.

If the knight collects a "Chalice of Youth", his score is increased. The knight can use his "Chalice of Youth" any time he wants to increase his health. Just by clicking on the "Chalice of Youth" and confirming, the knights health is fully restored, but he looses one of his "Chalice of Youth"

If the Knight collects a "Guardian Angel", his score is increased. The knight can use his "Guardian Angel" any time he wants to go to any White column visible on the board. Just by clicking on the "Guardian Angel" and confirming, the kinght is provided an option to go to any white column. A "Guardian Angel" can grant this wish only once. Once a "Guardian Angel" has been summoned for help and used, the available "Guardian Angel" is reduced by 1.

If the Knight collects a "Black Diamond", his score is increased. The knight can use his "Black Diamond" any time he wants to go to any Black column visible on the board. Just by clicking on the "Black Diamond" and confirming, the knight is provided an option to go to any black column. A "Black Diamond" can be use only once. Once a "Black Diamond" has been used, the available "Black Diamonds" are reduced by 1.

As the level progresses and the score increases. The knights rank increases. Once the Rank reaches "The King" the knight curse is lifted and he is restored all his glory and gifts. The Story ends there!
