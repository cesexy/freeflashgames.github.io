<h4>Game Description:</h4> Pixelotl is a laid-back 2D puzzle-platformer in which you control a salamander-like creature who on a mission to save his friends.This was a final project for a video game design class at Rutgers University. There are fifty levels split into five different worlds, each with different themes and challenges!

Unique in this game is the use of elastic platforms/blocks and a controllable gravitational field. While most platformers have rigid and stationary platforms, we instead have different colored blocks which move fluidly and react to the player. Also, by holding down spacebar, you can increase the gravity around him, making him much heavier and triggering interactions with nearby blocks.

Quick tip: If you hold down forward as you are walking or jumping into a block, the Pixelotl will automatically try to scamper up, letting you reach higher places! Also, some blocks will have different properties and powers to reach even HIGHER!

Have fun!
