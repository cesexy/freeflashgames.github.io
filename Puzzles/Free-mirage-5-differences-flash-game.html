 <p>Dugan's Du...</p><div id="d">After clearing first four floors of the King Dugan's dungeon, Beethro needs to face even greater adversaries - long, slithering serpents and the dreadful living tar.

----

Beethro Budkin, fifth-generation professional dungeon exterminator, was hired by King Dugan to clear the king's multi-level dungeon of a large monster infestation. Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid. The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword(tm), which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.

Your objective is to clear each level of King Dugan's Dungeon of monsters. This feat can be accomplished using only your Really Big Sword(tm) and your wits. Each room is a separate area that has to be cleared in a single session. Should you leave a room without completely clearing it, it will be restored to its initial state when you return.

Those brave enough can compete for the best score (least number of moves) in each room against players from all over the world. If you create an account on our forums and provide the CaravelNet details in the options menu), your scores will be submitted to the leaderboards. These will last for two weeks, unless you purchase a CaravelNet subscription, in which case your scores will be kept forever. If you do not type in the details, you will be only notified what place your score would've attained (so called anonymous scores).</div>
