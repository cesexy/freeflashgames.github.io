<h4>Game Description:</h4> This is a card match game.
However, it is not an ordinary one as you goal is to match only the cards that are set in your goal... Either the green or the yellow pictures at any given point.

The game features pictures of my wonderful cat for you to enjoy!
Playing it will help me feed and take care of my cat!

</div>
						

<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Click with your mouse on the cards to match them according to one of two goals set in the begining of the round:

Feed my cat: Match only yellow regular cat pictures
Feed my green cat: Match only green cat pictures

Matching the wrong cards to the goal... E.g. Green when normal yellow required ends the game.

As you can see, the game start easy and keep getting harder after every level with more chances to match a wrong pair of cards.

Remember! You can keep playing even if you click two unmatchable cards, even with the opposite color to your goal and the game won't over as long as you don't match two of the wrong color pair!

Also, the more you match in one row, the more bonus you get to your score, so try to match as many pairs straight in a row!

 <p>Color Link...</p><div id="d">Each puzzle consists of a grid containing colored clues in various places. Every clue, except for the 1's, is half of a pair. The object is to reveal a hidden picture by linking the pairs and painting the paths so that the number of squares (including the squares at the ends) and the color of the path is the same as the value and the color of the clues being linked together. Paths may follow horizontal or vertical directions and are not allowed to cross other paths. There is only one unique solution for each puzzle.</div>
