<h4>Game Description:</h4> String Chaos is a puzzle game.
In each level you will find beads which are connected by strings. To complete a level, you have to drag and drop the beads around in such a way, that the strings connecting them don't cross. The faster you solve a level, the higher your score.
Every three levels you complete, the world type changes (there is grass, space, ice and machine). Each world requires a slightly different strategy to win.

The game has no actual end. At any time, the player may choose to quit the game by pressing the yellow-black "exit and save score" button, to have his score saved for the high-score list and exit the game.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Drag and drop the beads around, simply by clicking on them, pulling them to a new location, and then releasing the mouse button.

Click on the black-yellow "save score and exit" button in the upper right corner, to exit the game and have your score inserted into the high score list.

Use the two small black buttons in the upper left corner, to toggle the sound effects and music, as well as the quality of the graphics and details.

The beads have different colors, to make sorting them more easy. Green: all strings connected to this bead are not crossing any other. Red: some strings connected to this bead are crossing another string. Black: the bead you are currently dragging around. White: beads connected to the bead, you are currently dragging around.

 <p>HoneySweep...</p><div id="d">Are you familiar with the computer game Minesweeper? We 
kept the intellectual charm of a logical puzzle and added 
a new and dynamic living environment. Honeycomb are used 
as a game field, and bees play the role of the mines.

At the beginning of the game the cells are completely covered 
with wax. The goal of the game is to open all of the cells 
as quickly as possible while trying not to be stung by a bee. 
You can open the cells by clicking of the left mouse button,
also you can mark the bees by press the SPACE button.

Each bee produces honey, therefore yellow "honey" rises 
in the neighboring opened cells around the bee. Each cell 
contains as much honey as the number of bees around it. 

Do not be afraid if you see the queen bee after a move. The queen is quite harmless and can be opened by clicking of the left mouse button. The queen bee feeds on honey, so all five cells under the queen don't have yellow "honey", even though the bees can be sitting around.</div>
