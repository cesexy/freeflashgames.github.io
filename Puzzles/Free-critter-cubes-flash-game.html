 <p>Rainbow Me...</p><div id="d">The chance of catching a glimpse of a beautiful rainbow may be rare, but with suitable devices you can create the glorious color beams on your own. Appreciate the magnificent combination of nature and science in Rainbow Mechanic, in which your goal is to place or remove mirrors so that the light can be directed to the prism and generate a rainbow. The first level of the game starts with a maze which contains a light source and a prism. You will be given a certain number of 45-degree mirrors in the selection panel at the bottom of the maze, and you can click to place the suitable mirrors onto the empty blocks in the maze. If you would like to remove a mirror, simply click the corresponding block again. Since the light always travels in a straight line, it will turn 90 degrees when it reaches a mirror. You may test the settings by clicking the Start button on the right of the selection panel so that the light starts to travel, and you may click the Stop button to continue placing or removing mirrors. If the light cannot be successfully directed to the prism, you can click the Reset button to remove all mirrors at once. As you advance in the game, you can utilize some solar powered devices to accomplish the task. The flashlight will be turned on when light meets it, while the solar powered fan can blow away light objects and plastic blocks in the maze, and the solar powered magnet can attract and move metal blocks so that new routes for the light become available. Bear in mind that each level has a specific time limit as displayed on the left of the selection panel, and if you fail to create a rainbow before the time runs out, you lose the game. Make use of the solar powered items wisely to cast the fascinating magic of the light!</div>
