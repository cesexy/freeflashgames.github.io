<h4>Game Description:</h4> Following the success of Hide Caesar and Hide Caesar II, we present a new selection of physics puzzles, created by the community using the powerful level editor tool.

Drop objects into the scene to shelter the roman coin from a hail of pebbles. Don't let the coin get hit by the stones or fall to the ground. All the features from Hide Caesar II return, including ropes and pivots, and Evil Caesar coins, which must be gotten rid of to pass the level. Hide Caesar 2 Players' Pack comes complete with a level editor and online hi-score tables.

 <p>Mental: Mu...</p><div id="d">Fred, Walter and Greg are finally reunited after their escape from the Insano Mental Institution in Capital City.

Unfortunately for them they had to resort to some violence during their escape and later on to avoid being caught by the police and mental health workers.

There is now a long list of citizens that have been killed or seriously injured by the trio. Their capture is no longer a local matter, nor is it a State matter; the seriousness of their crimes has upgraded their status to a national security threat and the FBI amongst other government agencies are now after them.

Box Laden has lost his place as the no. 1 most wanted person, replaced by the trio in positions 1, 2 and 3!

Your job is to help Fred, Walter and Greg escape capture and get to their home in the country. Can you do it? Solve the puzzles and save their lives. They are the true victims in all this!</div>

 <p>Green Lepr...</p><div id="d">Assist the leprechauns to cast their green magic and they will reward you handsomely! Your goal in this game is to place leprechauns onto the grid so as to turn the whole area green. When the game starts, you will be given a 10x10 grid which contains a number of shamrocks. Some of the shamrocks are marked with numbers, which indicate the quantities of leprechauns in the horizontally or vertically adjacent blocks. If a shamrock is not marked with a number, you can put any number of leprechauns beside it. A leprechaun can turn all the blocks that he can see green, but note that he cannot see through a block which contains a shamrock, and the leprechauns should not be seeing each other. Click an empty block to place a leprechaun, and the blocks that the leprechaun can see will all be turned into green color. You may also click the cross button on the right of the grid to mark a square which does not contain a leprechaun. The amount of time you have spent will be recorded at the top right corner of the screen. Will the mischievous leprechauns grant you wishes or will they escape from your hands?</div>
