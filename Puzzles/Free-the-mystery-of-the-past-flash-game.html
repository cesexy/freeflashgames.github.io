 <p>Gloid - Th...</p><div id="d">The idea in Gloid - The Levitation Robot is to combine established tile-based sidescroller jump'n'run and puzzle elements with new experimental components: The levitation makes Gloid float through the levels. He does so by pushing himself away from any walls within his levitation range, which can be increased or decreased by the player. As the player advances through the levels, more and more new elements will find their way into the game. This ranges from dangerous walls and whisps - which are needed in a correct color to open gates - to cannons, portals, and more.

The game features 25 normal, 10 hard and 5 bonus levels.</div>
