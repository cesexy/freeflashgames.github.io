<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Build a bridge using your mouse and available budget. When it is done click "Test your bridge". 
Your workers will use it to get items located at the other side of valley, and bring them back to the shop. Your goal is to collect all items in level.

For each level you have limited budget. All money that you won't use, become your score, so cheaper bridge = higher score. 
Money collected in all levels of game will be your total score and will be sent to leader board. You will use those money in challenge mode too.

Building tips:
* There are two types of bridge elemets: "walk" - workers can step on them, "connectors" - used only to connect elemets of the bridge, workers do not collide with them.
* "Connector" elements are cheaper and lighter so use them as much as you can
* Each type of item have different weight and some of them will need stronger bridge then others.
* At the begining of game only wood elements of bridge are available. In further levels, aditional materials will be accessible also, so use them wisely.

 <p>Switzerlan...</p><div id="d">The flag of Switzerland consists of a red flag with a white cross (a bold, equilateral cross) in the centre. It is one of only two square sovereign-state flags, the other being the flag of the Vatican City. (The civil and state ensign, used by Swiss ships and boats, has more traditional proportions of 2:3.)[1]
Only the dimensions of the cross are formally established since 1889: "The coat of arms of the federation is, within a red field, an upright white cross, whose [four] arms of equal length are a sixth longer than their width."[2] The size of the cross in relation to the field is not formally established except on the naval ensign, for which the ratio of the size of the cross to the height is 5:8, and to the length is 5:12.[3] A ratio of 2:3 or 7:10 to the span of the flag is usual.[citation needed]
Use of the white cross as a military ensign (attached to the cantonal flags in the form of strips of linen) has been used in the Old Swiss Confederacy since the 14th century, but the modern design of a white cross suspended in a square red field was introduced only after the end of the Napoleonic period, in 1815, and was introduced as official national flag in 1889.</div>
