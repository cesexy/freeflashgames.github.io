<h4>Game Description:</h4> Welcome to Crosser! The rules are simple: you need to cross all the dots with the lines, applying the patterns from 'Patterns' block. Just drag the pattern from it's area to play field, and choose the right position for it. You can not apply the pattern to the dots, which are already crossed, but you can move already applied patterns. Apply all the patterns,  get all the dots crossed, and then, go to next level. 
Good luck!
