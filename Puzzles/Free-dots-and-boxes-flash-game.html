<h4>Game Description:</h4> Join the dots. Win the box.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
There are three levels of game to play, each with its own high score table. Choose either to play the Best Of 3 Frames, Best Of 5 or Best Of 9 on the first screen. On the next screen you will see a grid of dots, 6 x 6. To start move your mouse pointer over the grid and you will find that yellow lines appear between the dots. Holding your mouse pointer over a line you wish to make and then clicking on it with the left button, will create that line. You must then click the OK button at the bottom of the grid to allow the computer to have its go. When you are able to add a fourth line and complete a square, your yellow smiley icon will automatically appear in the square and your score will increase by one. When the computer has a go, its line will appear in red and the 'Your Go' sign will show when it has finished its go. When you add a fourth line and complete a square, this may make another 3 line square nearby. You may click on the fourth line here to make another square in the same go. This may make another square a three liner too, so carry on until you can complete no more squares, all in the same go. In this case your final go before you click the OK button,(depending on what rules you are playing) must be to add a line somewhere else on the grid, even if it means that you have just made a three line square which the computer can complete.

 <p>MegaCity...</p><div id="d">MegaCity is a highly original and fun 'one-more-go' style puzzle game. It's easy to learn but hard and fun to master, featuring gameplay that requires thinking, logic and luck. 

Place requested buildings in the queue to earn points, but watch out: Nobody wants to live next to a landfill site or industrial estate! Everybody wants a nice park or shcool nearby, but the city's budget is limited. This is where you come in... 

Megacity is a game of planning and thinking ahead to squeeze the most points of out your citizens by clever town planning. And if it all goes wrong, it's their fault for electing you mayor, right? 

Megacity is a real thinking person's game, which appeals to and is suitable for all ages.</div>
