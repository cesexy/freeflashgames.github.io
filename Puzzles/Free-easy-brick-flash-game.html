<h4>Game Description:</h4> The Goal of the game is to remove all bricks from the board. The minimum number of bricks in group can not be lower than 2. When you click a brick, all the bricks that are connected to this brick by the same colour will be destroyed. The bricks that are above of the destroyed bricks will fall down and merge with other bricks.

It's a puzzle game about space management, probabilities, sacrifice, risk, skills, luck, time pressure and numbers.

For this 60s edition, you will have one more constraint, only 60s are available.

You have to make a path between tiles of same value (no diagonal).
One for the 1. Two for the 2. Three for the 3. And so on.
The linked tiles disappear and new ones arrive on top.
You gain points and time, one for the 1, four for the 2, nine for the 3 and so on.

You can change the values only with sacrifice. Two ways.
The bomb will destroy a tile and in exchange all tiles surrounding will increase by 1.
The atomic bomb will destroy a tile and in exchange all others tiles with the same value will disappear (you'll lose their points) and new ones arrive on top.

The game ends when there is no time or when all tiles have been sacrificied.

Atomic challenge make you play with the same numbers. Every player face the same challenge. Where will you rank ? 
The classic mode does not include the atomic bomb.</div>
