 <p>Brain Foll...</p><div id="d">This game will challenge your brain and memory skills to the max. Your objective is to follow the exact path the brain creature takes to reach the level end. If you stray off the path, you will fall into the pit of despair, where none may return.

Sound easy? You move slower than the brain creature - so you have to focus on where is has gone and what turns it has taken.

Still easy? There are demons and other obstacles that will make your life unpleasant and following the creatures path more difficult.

Remember you cannot leave the path the creature has taken - you can move backwards and forward on that path, but you cannot move off at any point.

Good luck and have fun remembering!</div>
