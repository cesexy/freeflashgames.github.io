 <p>The Time T...</p><div id="d">May be you already know this game, and have played it on paper.
Now you can play it on your PC as well!

In ordinary cross-word puzzle you need to guess the words and
place them horizontaly or verticaly to appropriate cells within
the game field. Of course, each pair of crossing horizontal and 
vertical words must have the same letter in the cell of intersection.

Unlike the cross-word puzzle, the game uses numbers in place of words. More then that, all numbers, that need to be placed on the game field, are known in advance. However, you don't know the cells within the game field, to which each number should be placed. As in cross-word, you can place numbers both horizontaly and verticaly, and each crossing pair of numbers must have the same digit in the cell of their intersection.

Remember, that the objective of the game is to fill in the game field from the offered set of numbers.

Don't be surprised, if after filling in all of the free cells you still
have unused numbers. They are check numbers. If the game field was filled correctly, you may find them in one of the columns or rows of the game field. After this you will need to place them in the appropriate position.

The game have 30 puzzles with different levels of the difficulty.</div>
