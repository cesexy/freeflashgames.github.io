 <p>Paint it R...</p><div id="d">It's a game, where your playground is a piece of abstract art. Yours art. Screen is a canvas, mouse is a paintbrush, and paint... Well, paint is a cloud of particles that are very liberated. But controllable. Mostly. Not to mention that canvas sometimes also takes active role, changing colours that you already have drawn.

There is no objective measure of art value to rate a result of struggle between you, paint and canvas. But we can measure some things, like, well, how RED is it. So, paint it red. Paint is as red as possible and as fast as possible to unlock levels and gain in-game medals. And enjoy the art that you are making yourself.</div>

Dibbles is an updated take on Lemmings, but with our own unique and original twist.  Each action costs a Dibble and you only have to save the king to progress, with a bonus for saving extra Dibbles.  Instead of clicking on the Dibbles, you place command stones - the first Dibble to encounter the stone will carry out it's orders, in most cases they will remember the order until it's the right time to carry it out, meaning you can queue up commands.
