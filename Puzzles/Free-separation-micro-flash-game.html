<h4>Game Description:</h4> Separation is a new and exciting game where you will need quick fingers and a sharp mind to keep up with the action!

You must move the balls from the centre of the screen to the correct areas to score as many points as possible. Moving a ball to the wrong area, or taking too long with result in balls being Locked Down!

There are 6 different modes in this game:

Freeplay Mode:
In this mode you can practice your ball control skills and get used to the game. This mode is unlimited, with no ball lockdowns and no time limits, try and get a high score!

Stamina Mode:
In stamina mode, you must remove the balls from the central area within 2 seconds or the ball will lock down. If all balls are locked down, or if you place a ball incorrectly, the game will end. How long can you last?

Blitz Mode:
You have 60 seconds, no lock downs. Move the balls as fast as you can before the time runs out to get the highest score.

Copycat Mode:
You will need to match the pattern shown at the start of each round. If you get it wrong, GAME OVER! The longer you last, the higher your score.

Numbers Mode:
Each area will have a sum inside it, you will need to match the numbers on the balls to the sums inside the areas. A wrong move will lock the ball down, you have 6 seconds to move it from the central area.

Colours Mode:
This is the hardest mode, the centre of each ball is coloured as well, you will either be instructed to match the inside or the outside colour of the ball to the correct area, any wrong moves will lock down the ball!

Play with your friends and see who can get the highest score!

 <p>Light Cube...</p><div id="d">Light Cubed is a simple, pick-up-and-play game that's easy to learn and difficult to master. Place white blocks on the screen and they fill up the bar at the bottom of the screen. Fill the bar to complete the level. Simple, huh?

Well no. As the levels progress, things begin to get in your way. You'll be able to complete the 12 levels in this short puzzle game fairly easily... but that's only the beginning.

Although simple, there are many exploits and tricks you can use to shave 100ths of a second off your time. Use your uber micro to replace bar-sapping blocker blocks when they're not required. Riskily place white blocks in dangerous levels to get the lead over rivals and their times. Go through all 12 levels at once to score the ultimate prize- the campaign lowest time!

Give this game a quick go and play along to the noisy trance beat. You never know, it could even be fun!</div>
