 <p>Marble Lin...</p><div id="d">Will you surrender to the perilous streams of marbles and the attack from your opponent, or are you the victorious fighter who can survive till the end? Take control of the battle and tame your rival, then claim yourself worthy of the title of numero uno! In this game, your goal is to shoot and form groups of at least 3 marbles of the same color so as to destroy them and clear the lines. When the game opens, a line of colored marbles will be rolling on the path of a maze and moving towards a hole at the end of the path. Between the lines of the maze you will be given a launcher, in which a marble will be placed inside and ready for the shot, and the next piece will also be displayed. You may move your mouse to change the shooting direction of the launcher, then click to release the marble. If groups of at least 3 marbles of the same color are formed after launching, those pieces will be destroyed and a gap will be formed. If the color of the two marbles on the sides of the gap is the same, then these marbles will merge and the gap will be closed, but if this is not the case, the gap will then remain. The play area of your opponent will be displayed at the right of your area, allowing you to observe the current game process of your rival. To attack and slow down your opponent, you can perform the following special tricks to transform some of his marbles into stones. First of all, you may perform a "gap shot," which is to shoot through a gap and destroy marbles on the next line. You may also form multiple combos of marbles which can be removed with one shot, as the pieces on either side of a gap will collide and be removed when they are of the same color. Even if you are under attack of your opponent, you may retaliate and transform some of his or her pieces into rocks by removing multiple stones all at once. If the pieces of a player reach the hole at the end of the path, the game ends. Prepare yourself as you step into the fiery war zone and experience the thrilling sensation of Marble Lines Battle!</div>
