 <p>Duchess Tr...</p><div id="d">Duchess Tri-Peak is a classic solitaire variation by Free-Online-World.com. The object of the game is to move all of the cards from the tableau to the foundation. The foundation may be built up or down regardless of suit. For example, if the Foundation is showing a 5, then a 4 or 6 may be played onto it. When you're unable to make any more moves, turn over the top of the stock and place it face-up on top of the foundation pile, then once again make any moves available on the tableau. There are 20 levels and picturesque graphics that make this game even more addictive.</div>

 <p>Demon Soli...</p><div id="d">Play and see whether the demon card is a friend or a foe! The object of this game seems simple - to move all cards to 4 foundations. Yet it comes with a twist that the order of cards in the foundations must start with the number of the demon card dealt to the foundations, for example, if a 6 is dealt to the foundations, then each of the foundations must start with a 6. Cards in the foundations should also be built up by suit, wrapping from K to A if necessary. When the game starts, all cards are downturned and placed on the stock pile at the top left corner. Then 1 upturned card will be dealt to the discard pile on the right of the stock pile, and 13 cards will be dealt to the reserve pile under the discard pile. The foundations at the top right corner will be dealt 1 upturned card as the demon, while each of the 4 tableau piles underneath will also be dealt 1 upturned card. The cards can be arranged on the tableau piles before moving to the foundations. Cards on the tableau piles should be built down by alternating colors, wrapping from A to K if necessary. When a tableau pile is empty, a card from the reserve pile will automatically move to fill the position. If the reserve pile is used up, an empty tableau pile can be occupied by any card. Click the stock pile to deal a new card whenever necessary. If you are not satisfied with the progress, you can click the Give Up button at the bottom left corner to quit the current game. The stock pile allows unlimited redeals, but each redeal costs 1000 points, so defend your score and win the trophy with the smallest number of reuses!</div>
