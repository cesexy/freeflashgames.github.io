<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Construction and layout:
- One standard 52-card deck is used.
- There are four open cells and four open foundations. 
- The entire deck is dealt out left to right into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. 

Building during play:
- The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.
- Tableaux must be built down by the same suit.
- Foundations are built up by suit.

Moves:
- Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.
- Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. 

Victory:
The game is won after all cards are moved in ascending number by suit to their foundation piles.
