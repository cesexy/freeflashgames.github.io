(NOTE FULL INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN GAME) 

Welcome to Kyubiko. Kyubiko is a puzzle game that starts off simple but quickly turns challenging. It's cute, but looks difficult to play, you say? Nonsense, it's very simple. Here's how to play...


Board/Spawning:
This is the Kyubiko game board where you play the game. Each corner is timed to release a random colored block. Before each block is released, there are arrows that indicate which direction they will be moving in. The outside edge of this game board holds all of your active blocks before you set them. This is how you set them...

Controls:
You set your blocks by using your mouse to click on the moving block at the precise moment as it is navigating in the outside edge of the game board. Now let's see what we're working with...

Blocks:
There are 7 types of known blocks in Kyubiko. First there are the normal blocks: red, yellow, blue, and green blocks. Then there are special blocks which enable power ups. These are the same color as normal blocks, but with a special sparkle. Next you have rocks. Rocks are another type of special blocks that cannot be destroyed except by special power ups. Anchor blocks are indestructible. They are used to start off your scoring chains.

Scoring points:
So how do you score points? There are many ways to score, but the most common is to match a minimum of four colored blocks in a row or in a square. You may also score with higher combinations. Here are just a few examples: 2x3, 4 or more in a row, and a plus symbol. You score 4k for a basic move and an additional 4k per extra block destroyed in the bomb.

 <p>Christmas ...</p><div id="d">The Goal of the game is to remove all bricks from the board. The minimum number of bricks in group can not be lower than 2. When you click a brick, all the bricks that are connected to this brick by the same colour will be destroyed. The bricks that are above of the destroyed bricks will fall down and merge with other bricks. To get a bigger bonus when you destroy a group of equally colored bricks, it is better to have as many bricks as possible. The game has 28 levels. After every seventh level you'll get a new colored brick and 5 magic bricks.  If level is cleared  number of magic bricks will be restored to 5 and bonus points will be awarded depending on number of colors in level.</div>
